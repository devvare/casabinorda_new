 REPLAGAL (agalsidase alfa) 1 mg/3.5 mL Concentrate for Solution for Infusion – PRODUCT INFORMATION

1. Product Description  
REPLAGAL is a sterile, clear, colorless solution intended for intravenous infusion. Each 3.5 mL vial contains 3.5 mg of agalsidase alfa, a recombinant form of the human enzyme α-galactosidase A. It is produced in a human cell line using genetic engineering techniques. This enzyme replacement therapy is designed for the long-term treatment of Fabry Disease—a rare genetic disorder resulting from α-galactosidase A deficiency.

2. Indications and Usage  
REPLAGAL is indicated for the long-term treatment of patients diagnosed with Fabry Disease. The deficiency in α-galactosidase A leads to the accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) in various body tissues, including the kidneys, heart, and nervous system. REPLAGAL works by supplementing the missing or deficient enzyme, thereby reducing the pathological storage of Gb3 and alleviating associated clinical symptoms.

3. Dosage and Administration  
The recommended dose of REPLAGAL is 0.2 mg/kg administered intravenously over a 40-minute period every two weeks. The solution must be diluted in 100 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride and delivered using a sterile, aseptic technique. Administration should be supervised by a physician experienced in managing metabolic disorders. Patients tolerating the therapy may be eligible for home infusion or self-administration after proper training and under physician guidance.

4. Special Populations  
- Pediatrics (7–18 years): The recommended dose is identical to that in adults. Clinical studies have shown comparable efficacy and safety in this group.
- Children under 7: Safety and efficacy have not been established; no dosing recommendations can be provided.
- Elderly and Renal Impairment: No specific dose adjustment is required, although extensive renal damage may diminish therapeutic effect.
- Hepatic Impairment: No formal studies have been conducted; caution is advised.

5. Pharmacodynamics and Clinical Efficacy  
REPLAGAL catalyzes the hydrolysis of Gb3, reversing storage in affected cells. Clinical trials demonstrated:
- Reduced pain scores and neuropathic symptoms.
- Stabilized renal function and increased glomerular filtration rates.
- Decreased left ventricular mass and improved myocardial contractility.
- Sustained reduction in plasma and urinary Gb3 levels across long-term use (up to 4 years).

In pediatric studies, a normalization of elevated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was observed, as well as improved heart rate variability. Quality-of-life assessments also indicated enhancements in energy levels and general well-being.

6. Adverse Reactions  
The most commonly reported adverse effects are infusion-associated reactions (13.7% in adults), typically within the first few months of treatment. These include:
- Very common: Chills, fever, nausea, fatigue, rash, headache, abdominal pain, joint pain.
- Common: Flushing, palpitations, dizziness, hoarseness, hyperhidrosis.
- Uncommon: Anaphylactic reactions, cardiac arrhythmias, angioneurotic edema.

Patients with pre-existing cardiac issues may experience exacerbated cardiac symptoms due to infusion-related stress.

7. Immunogenicity  
Antibodies to agalsidase alfa (IgG) were observed in approximately 24% of male patients, though many developed tolerance over time. Antibody presence did not appear to affect safety or efficacy significantly. Pediatric populations had lower immunogenicity rates.

8. Drug Interactions  
REPLAGAL should not be used concurrently with chloroquine, amiodarone, benoquin, or gentamicin due to potential inhibition of α-galactosidase activity. As a protein therapeutic, it is unlikely to participate in cytochrome P450-mediated interactions.

9. Storage and Handling  
REPLAGAL should be stored between 2–8°C and protected from light. Once diluted, it should be administered immediately; if delayed, use within 24 hours is permissible if stored between 2–8°C under aseptic conditions. Do not mix with other medicinal products.

10. Supply and Distribution  
The concentrate is supplied in 5 mL Type I glass vials containing 3.5 mL of solution. Packs of 1, 4, or 10 vials are available. Distribution must adhere to regional regulatory standards. All pharmaceutical entities involved in wholesale or institutional distribution should maintain cold-chain integrity. International import or export must meet national guidelines and certification requirements to ensure safety and efficacy during transit. Patients should never buy this product from unauthorized sources, as clinical supervision is essential for safe administration.

11. Manufacturer and Authorization  
REPLAGAL is manufactured by Takeda Pharmaceuticals International AG, Ireland Branch. It is authorized by the European Medicines Agency and is available under prescription-only conditions.

12. Risk Minimization and Self-Administration  
A structured program is in place for training patients and caregivers for home infusion. Educational materials and infusion diaries are provided to ensure safety. Only patients who have demonstrated good tolerance and are deemed clinically stable are eligible for self-administration.

13. Summary  
REPLAGAL offers a vital enzyme replacement therapy option for Fabry Disease, with proven efficacy in symptom relief, organ protection, and improved quality of life. Continued treatment under professional supervision is key to managing this chronic condition.
