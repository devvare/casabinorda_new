 AKLOVIR 5% CREAM (Acyclovir) – PRODUCT INFORMATION

 1. Product Overview

AKLOVIR® 5% Cream is a topical antiviral medication containing acyclovir, a synthetic purine nucleoside analogue with potent antiviral activity against Herpes simplex virus (HSV) types 1 and 2. It is indicated for the treatment of herpetic skin infections, including herpes labialis (cold sores) and genital herpes, both for primary and recurrent episodes.

Each gram of AKLOVIR cream contains 50 mg of acyclovir. It is formulated as a smooth, off-white cream with a characteristic odor and is supplied in aluminum tubes of 2 g and 10 g. The product is distributed through pharmaceutical supply networks and is available to healthcare institutions and patients via wholesale channels. In some cases, it may also be subject to import or export regulations due to its antiviral nature.

These ingredients are included to enhance skin absorption and ensure stability of the formulation. However, propylene glycol and cetostearyl alcohol may cause local skin reactions or irritation in some individuals.



 3. Indications

AKLOVIR is indicated for:
- Treatment of initial and recurrent Herpes simplex virus infections of the skin
- Herpes labialis (cold sores) and genital herpes
- Application to early-stage lesions (erythema or prodrome) for optimal efficacy



 4. Dosage and Administration

 Recommended dosage:
- Apply 5 times a day at approximately 4-hour intervals, omitting the nighttime dose
- Initiate treatment as soon as symptoms appear (tingling, itching, or redness)
- Duration:
  - At least 4 days for herpes labialis
  - At least 5 days for genital herpes
  - Treatment may be extended up to 10 days if healing is incomplete

 Method of administration:
- For topical use only
- Apply a thin layer directly to the affected skin using a clean fingertip
- Avoid contact with eyes, mouth, and mucous membranes such as the vagina

 Special populations:
- No specific data available for pediatric, geriatric, renal, or hepatic impairment
- Use cautiously in immunocompromised individuals, who may require oral antiviral therapy



 5. Contraindications

Do not use AKLOVIR if:
- You have a known hypersensitivity to acyclovir, valacyclovir, propylene glycol, or any other ingredients in the cream
- There is evidence of contact dermatitis or severe skin sensitivity from prior use



 6. Warnings and Precautions

- AKLOVIR is not suitable for ophthalmic or intravaginal use
- Accidental contact with eyes must be avoided
- Immunocompromised patients (e.g., AIDS or transplant patients) should consult a physician for potential systemic treatment
- If irritation or hypersensitivity occurs, discontinue use immediately
- Do not use as a base for compounding or mixing with other medications



 7. Drug Interactions

No clinically significant drug interactions have been reported with topical acyclovir.

However, care should be taken when using other topical skin products simultaneously, as they may alter the absorption or efficacy of acyclovir.



 8. Use in Special Populations

 Pregnancy:
- AKLOVIR is classified as Pregnancy Category B
- Limited data suggests no increased risk of fetal harm; however, use should be restricted to cases where the benefit clearly outweighs any potential risk

 Lactation:
- Systemic absorption from topical use is minimal
- Risk to the breastfeeding infant is considered negligible

 Fertility:
- No negative impact on male or female fertility has been reported in clinical or non-clinical studies



 9. Side Effects

 Common (≥1/100 to <1/10):
- Mild burning or stinging after application
- Skin dryness or flaking
- Itching at the site of application

 Uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100):
- Redness or rash
- Contact dermatitis

 Rare to very rare (≤1/10,000):
- Swelling of lips, face, or throat (angioedema)
- Hypersensitivity reactions

Most adverse effects are mild and resolve spontaneously. If severe irritation or allergic response develops, treatment should be discontinued.



 10. Overdose

Accidental ingestion of an entire tube (e.g., 500 mg of cream) is unlikely to cause significant adverse effects. However, systemic ingestion of multiple doses over time may lead to:
- Nausea, vomiting
- Headache
- Neurological symptoms (confusion)

Hemodialysis may be considered for systemic acyclovir overdose, though it is rarely needed for topical exposure.



 11. Pharmacological Properties

 Pharmacodynamics:
- Acyclovir inhibits viral DNA polymerase after being phosphorylated by viral thymidine kinase
- Selectively targets HSV-infected cells
- Reduces the duration and severity of outbreaks when applied early

 Pharmacokinetics:
- Minimal systemic absorption after topical application
- Detected in plasma and urine at very low levels when used in standard dosages



 12. Storage and Stability

- Store below 25°C
- Do not refrigerate or freeze
- Keep in original packaging, away from light and moisture
- Keep out of reach of children



 13. Packaging and Distribution

AKLOVIR is supplied in 2 g and 10 g aluminum tubes. Each unit is enclosed in a cardboard box with instructions for use. The product is available for purchase by pharmacies and hospitals and may be included in wholesale orders.

AKLOVIR is not an over-the-counter product in most jurisdictions and should only be bought under prescription. It is sometimes part of import and export orders, particularly for humanitarian and clinical supply chains in areas with high HSV prevalence.
