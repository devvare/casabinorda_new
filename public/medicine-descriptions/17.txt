 Warnings and Precautions

 Gastrointestinal Safety

Serious gastrointestinal risks include ulcers, bleeding, and perforation. These events may occur without warning and are more likely in elderly patients or those with a history of peptic ulcer disease. Concomitant use with aspirin or corticosteroids increases this risk.

 Cardiovascular and Cerebrovascular Effects

NSAIDs like asemetacin may be associated with an increased risk of arterial thrombotic events such as myocardial infarction or stroke, especially with long-term use or in patients with existing cardiovascular risk factors.

RANTUDIL FORTE should be prescribed only after careful evaluation in patients with hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, or those who smoke.

 Renal and Hepatic Monitoring

Prolonged use can impact kidney and liver function. Regular monitoring of liver enzymes, kidney function tests, and blood parameters is essential during extended therapy.

 Dermatologic Reactions

Severe skin reactions, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis, though rare, can occur. Treatment must be discontinued at the first signs of rash or hypersensitivity.
