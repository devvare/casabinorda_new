 CORASPIN 100 MG – PRODUCT INFORMATION

 1. Product Description

CORASPIN® 100 mg enteric-coated tablets contain acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), a medication known for its antiplatelet activity. Each tablet delivers 100 mg of acetylsalicylic acid and is specifically formulated with an enteric coating to reduce gastric irritation, allowing the tablet to dissolve in the intestine rather than the stomach.

CORASPIN is available in blister packs of 30 white, round, enteric-coated tablets. The formulation is suitable for long-term cardiovascular therapy and designed for optimal tolerability.

 2. Therapeutic Indications

CORASPIN is used to reduce the risk of thromboembolic events due to its ability to prevent platelet aggregation. It is indicated for:

- Unstable angina pectoris: As part of standard therapy
- Acute myocardial infarction (heart attack)
- Secondary prevention of heart attacks (re-infarction)
- Prevention of thromboembolic complications after cardiac surgeries like PTCA or CABG
- Prevention of transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) and ischemic strokes in high-risk individuals

This low-dose aspirin therapy plays a crucial role in long-term cardiovascular risk management.

 3. Dosage and Administration

 General Dosage (Adults):

- 75–300 mg once daily, depending on indication and clinical evaluation
- Taken preferably 30 minutes before meals
- Tablets should be swallowed whole with plenty of water
- Do not crush or chew

 Special Populations:

- Children under 18: Not recommended due to the risk of Reye’s syndrome, especially during viral illnesses.
- Elderly: No specific dose adjustment required, but monitor for bleeding risk.
- Renal or hepatic impairment: Use with caution. Contraindicated in severe impairment.

 4. Contraindications

Do not use CORASPIN if you have:

- Allergy to acetylsalicylic acid or other salicylates
- NSAID-induced asthma or severe allergic reactions
- Active peptic ulcers
- Bleeding disorders (e.g., hemophilia)
- Severe liver, kidney, or heart failure
- Concurrent use of high-dose methotrexate (≥15 mg/week)
- Pregnancy (third trimester)

Use should be avoided in cases of acute gastrointestinal bleeding and in combination with certain anticoagulants unless closely monitored.

 5. Warnings and Precautions

- Monitor patients with a history of ulcers, gastrointestinal bleeding, or kidney dysfunction
- Use with caution in asthmatic patients or those with nasal polyps
- Discontinue before surgery or dental procedures due to increased bleeding risk
- May increase bleeding time even in small doses
- Aspirin reduces uric acid excretion, potentially triggering gout attacks
- Avoid concurrent use with alcohol, as it enhances gastrointestinal risk

 6. Use in Pregnancy and Lactation

- Not recommended in the third trimester due to risks of delayed labor, bleeding, and fetal cardiovascular issues
- Should only be used in the first two trimesters if absolutely necessary
- Trace amounts pass into breast milk. Occasional use is acceptable, but regular use during breastfeeding should be avoided

Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception if long-term aspirin therapy is considered necessary.

 7. Drug Interactions

The effect of CORASPIN can be increased or decreased by several medications:

 Increased Risk of Bleeding:
- Anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin)
- SSRIs
- NSAIDs and corticosteroids
- Thrombolytics and antiplatelets
- Valproic acid

 Potential Reduced Effect:
- Diuretics and ACE inhibitors
- Uricosuric agents like probenecid and sulfinpyrazone
- Methotrexate clearance may be reduced
- Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (theoretical)

Combining CORASPIN with metamizole or ibuprofen may reduce its antiplatelet efficacy. This is especially significant in patients on aspirin for cardiovascular protection.

 8. Side Effects

 Common:
- Gastrointestinal discomfort: nausea, heartburn, abdominal pain
- Mild bleeding (e.g., gum or nosebleeds)
- Micro-hemorrhages leading to occult blood loss over time

 Uncommon:
- Gastrointestinal ulcers or bleeding
- Skin reactions: rash, urticaria
- Elevated liver enzymes

 Rare but Serious:
- Severe allergic reactions including anaphylaxis
- Asthma attacks in susceptible individuals
- Hemolytic anemia in patients with G6PD deficiency
- Cerebral bleeding in patients on anticoagulants
- Acute renal failure, especially in dehydrated patients

If black stools, blood in vomit, or signs of allergy occur, seek immediate medical attention.

 9. Overdose

Symptoms of overdose may include:

- Ringing in the ears (tinnitus), vomiting, sweating
- Hyperventilation, metabolic acidosis, confusion
- Seizures or coma in severe cases

Management includes activated charcoal, fluid/electrolyte correction, and possibly hemodialysis in critical cases.
