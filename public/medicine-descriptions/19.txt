 BENICAL COLD – PRODUCT INFORMATION

 Product Overview

BENICAL COLD® 500 mg / 30 mg / 20 mg film-coated tablet is a fixed-dose combination medication formulated to alleviate symptoms associated with cold, flu, and upper respiratory tract infections. Each tablet contains:

This pharmaceutical product provides comprehensive relief from symptoms such as fever, headache, nasal congestion, runny nose, and dry cough. The combination of these three active agents is designed to improve patient comfort during viral infections.

 Pharmaceutical Form

The product is presented as film-coated tablets, oval-shaped, grey-yellow in color, with convex surfaces. Tablets are intended for oral administration.

 Indications

BENICAL COLD is indicated for the symptomatic treatment of cold and flu-like conditions characterized by:

- Fever
- Pain (e.g., sore throat, muscle aches, headache)
- Non-productive (dry) cough

 Administration:
- Swallow whole with a full glass of water
- Do not chew or crush the tablet

Maximum duration of use should not exceed 5 consecutive days, and the daily dose of paracetamol should not exceed 2,000 mg in individuals who consume alcohol regularly due to increased risk of hepatotoxicity.

- Use in children under 12 years is contraindicated

 Warnings and Precautions

 Hepatic and Renal Impairment

- Patients with liver disease, including hepatitis or cirrhosis, should use paracetamol-containing products with caution. Overuse may lead to irreversible liver damage.
- Renal impairment can reduce the clearance of pseudoephedrine, necessitating dose adjustments.

 Serotonin Syndrome

- Dextromethorphan may cause serotonin syndrome, especially when combined with SSRIs, MAO inhibitors, or CYP2D6 inhibitors.
- Symptoms include agitation, confusion, muscle twitching, shivering, and gastrointestinal distress.

 Dependence Risk

- Dextromethorphan has been associated with abuse and dependence, particularly among adolescents.
- Long-term use may result in physical or psychological dependence.

 Cardiovascular Effects

- Pseudoephedrine may elevate blood pressure and induce arrhythmias in predisposed individuals. Monitor in those with cardiovascular conditions.

 Interactions with Other Medicines

BENICAL COLD may interact with:

- MAO inhibitors, SSRIs, tricyclic antidepressants – risk of hypertensive crisis or serotonin syndrome
- Warfarin or other anticoagulants – increased bleeding risk with prolonged paracetamol use
- CYP2D6 inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, paroxetine, quinidine) – increased dextromethorphan levels
- CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, sedatives) – enhanced sedative effects
- Beta-blockers or antihypertensives – reduced effectiveness due to pseudoephedrine
- Mucolytic agents – may increase respiratory secretions and reduce the antitussive effect

Patients should avoid using multiple medications containing paracetamol, dextromethorphan, or pseudoephedrine concurrently.

 Use in Special Populations

 Pregnancy and Lactation

- Pregnancy Category C. Should only be used when the potential benefit outweighs the risk.
- Paracetamol and pseudoephedrine are excreted in breast milk. Use during breastfeeding is not recommended.

- Palpitations, high blood pressure

 Rare but Serious:
- Allergic reactions including anaphylaxis
- Hepatotoxicity, especially with overdose
- Serotonin syndrome
- Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis

If serious side effects occur, discontinue use and seek immediate medical attention.

 Overdose

 Paracetamol:
- Overdose can lead to acute liver failure. Early symptoms include nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Late signs include jaundice and coagulation disorders.

 Pseudoephedrine:
- High doses may cause hypertension, psychosis, hallucinations, seizures, or coma.

 Dextromethorphan:
- Symptoms of overdose include CNS depression, confusion, hallucinations, and potentially fatal respiratory depression.
