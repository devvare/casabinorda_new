 2. Composition

Active substance:
- Activated carbon (50 g per 240 mL)

Excipients:
- Deionized water

AQUA-CARBO is a dense, black, odorless suspension.



 3. Therapeutic Indications

AQUA-CARBO is indicated for:
- The adsorption of toxic substances ingested orally in cases of accidental or intentional poisoning
- Use in drug overdoses, especially when prompt gastrointestinal decontamination is required

It is effective in binding various drugs and chemicals, reducing their absorption in the gastrointestinal tract.



 4. Dosage and Administration

 Method of Administration
- Oral use only
- Shake well before use
- May be administered alone or after gastric lavage
- Flavored substances (e.g., chocolate, fruit juice) may improve taste but should not interfere with efficacy

 Adults and Adolescents (≥12 years)
- Single dose: 25–100 grams of activated carbon
- Repeated dose (for sustained-release toxins or enterohepatic recirculation): Initial dose of 50–100 grams followed by 12.5 grams every 1–4 hours

 Children (1–12 years)
- Single dose: 25–50 grams
- Repeated dose: 10–25 grams initially, followed by 2.5–6 grams (0.25 g/kg) every 1–4 hours

 Infants (<1 year)
- 0.5–1 g/kg single dose

 Geriatric Population
- No specific data; use as in adults with caution

Note: If ipecac syrup is used to induce vomiting, AQUA-CARBO should be administered only after vomiting has ceased.



 5. Contraindications

AQUA-CARBO must not be used in patients who:
- Are allergic to activated charcoal or excipients
- Have ingested corrosive substances (e.g., acids, alkalis)
- Are unconscious or seizing and not intubated
- Have intestinal obstructions or impaired gastrointestinal motility



 6. Warnings and Precautions

- Ineffective for: cyanide, iron salts, ethanol, methanol, lithium, mineral acids, and organic solvents
- Should not be mixed with: milk, ice cream, sherbet, or marmalade due to reduced efficacy
- Must be used cautiously with drugs that inhibit gastrointestinal motility, such as opioids and anticholinergics
- Patients should be monitored for vomiting and risk of aspiration, especially when large doses are rapidly administered
- Respiratory complications are rare but may occur due to aspiration



 7. Drug Interactions

Activated carbon can bind and reduce the efficacy of co-administered oral medications, such as:
- Antiemetics
- Specific antidotes
- Other oral medications

To ensure optimal therapeutic effect, other drugs should be administered either prior to or after a sufficient time gap following AQUA-CARBO.



 8. Use in Special Populations

 Pregnancy and Lactation
- Pregnancy Category C
- Not enough human data; use only if clearly needed
- No known teratogenic or fetotoxic effects have been reported
- Safe during breastfeeding

 Fertility
- No known effects on reproductive capacity



 9. Side Effects

Generally well tolerated. Most side effects are related to improper administration.

 Known adverse effects:

- Common (≥1/100 to <1/10): Constipation, black stools
- Uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100): Nausea, abdominal bloating
- Rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000): Vomiting, intestinal obstruction
- Unknown frequency:
  - Aspiration leading to airway blockage
  - Hypokalemia, hypermagnesemia, or hypernatremia (when used with cathartics)
  - Allergic skin reactions

Seek immediate medical attention in cases of suspected aspiration or gastrointestinal complications.



 10. Overdose and Management

AQUA-CARBO has no known systemic toxicity and is considered safe even in large doses. However, if excessive quantities are taken:
- Supportive treatment is usually sufficient
- Laxatives may be administered to aid elimination
- Monitor for gastrointestinal obstruction or aspiration risk



 11. Pharmacological Properties

 Pharmacodynamics
- Activated charcoal binds toxic substances in the gut through adsorption
- Prevents systemic absorption and may also reduce enterohepatic recirculation

 Pharmacokinetics
- Not absorbed systemically
- Excreted unchanged via feces
- Onset of action is rapid when administered soon after toxin ingestion



 12. Storage and Handling

- Store below 25°C in a dry place
- Protect from light and moisture
- Keep out of the reach of children
- Do not use after the expiration date
