 ADRENALIN (adrenaline) 1 mg/1 mL – 10 Ampoules – PRODUCT INFORMATION

 1. Product Description

ADRENALIN® 1 mg/1 mL is a sterile, preservative-free injectable solution containing adrenaline (epinephrine), a naturally occurring catecholamine with potent alpha- and beta-adrenergic stimulant properties. It is used in emergency medical situations, including cardiac arrest, anaphylaxis, severe bronchospasm, and superficial bleeding control.

Each 1 mL amber glass ampoule contains:
- 1 mg adrenaline (as adrenaline hydrochloride)
- 8.0 mg sodium chloride
- 1.5 mg sodium metabisulfite
- Water for injection (to 1 mL)

The solution is colorless and clear. It is intended for intramuscular (IM), subcutaneous (SC), intravenous (IV), intracardiac, endotracheal, or topical administration, depending on the indication. Distributed through pharmaceutical and wholesale networks, ADRENALIN may be included in import or export orders for emergency medical supply programs. Hospitals, emergency response centers, and licensed institutions may purchase this life-saving medication as part of essential critical care inventories. It is not appropriate to buy for home storage without professional medical oversight.



 2. Indications

ADRENALIN is indicated for the management of:
- Cardiac arrest during resuscitation
- Anaphylactic shock and severe acute allergic reactions
- Severe bronchospasm in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
- Superficial bleeding control from skin and mucous membranes
- Prolongation of local anesthesia (used by dentists and surgeons to extend anesthetic effect)



 3. Dosage and Administration

 Anaphylaxis and Severe Allergic Reactions:
- Adults: 0.1–0.5 mg (0.1–0.5 mL), IM or SC
- Repeat every 10–15 minutes as needed; total dose should not exceed 1 mg per injection

 Asthma and Bronchospasm:
- Adults: 0.3 mg (0.3 mL) SC, repeat every 20 minutes for up to 3 doses

 Cardiac Arrest:
- Adults: 0.5–1 mg IV or intracardiac, repeated every 3–5 minutes
- Endotracheal: 1–2 mg diluted in 10 mL sterile water

 Children (Pediatrics):
- Anaphylaxis: 0.01 mg/kg (maximum 0.5 mg), IM or SC
- Cardiac arrest: 0.01 mg/kg IV; do not exceed 1 mg per dose

 Topical Use:
- Hemostasis: Apply adrenaline solution (1:50,000 to 1:1,000) on gauze or spray
- Dental anesthesia: Mixed at 1:200,000 concentration with local anesthetic

 Important Considerations:
- Avoid use in gluteus muscles due to risk of anaerobic infection
- Always dilute for IV use
- Massage injection site to enhance absorption in SC or IM routes



 4. Contraindications

- Severe hypertension
- Hyperthyroidism
- Coronary artery disease or heart failure
- Uncontrolled diabetes
- Pheochromocytoma
- Closed-angle glaucoma
- During general anesthesia with halogenated hydrocarbons (e.g., halothane)
- In combination with local anesthetics in fingers, toes, nose, ears, or genitals
- Hypersensitivity to adrenaline or excipients, especially sodium metabisulfite



 5. Warnings and Precautions

ADRENALIN is reserved for life-threatening situations, but caution is still required:

- May cause cardiac arrhythmias, stroke, or pulmonary edema in elderly patients or those with cardiovascular disease
- Risk of necrosis at injection site with repeated use
- May induce hyperglycemia, lactic acidosis, and metabolic changes
- Contains sodium metabisulfite, which may trigger bronchospasm or anaphylaxis in sensitive individuals

Carefully monitor patients with:
- Ischemic heart disease
- Diabetes mellitus
- Hypertension
- Hyperthyroidism
- Psychiatric disorders
- Asthma or COPD



 6. Interactions

Potentiated by:
- MAO inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, levodopa, oxytocin
- Antihistamines (chlorpheniramine, diphenhydramine)
- Herbal stimulants containing caffeine or ephedra

Inhibited or altered by:
- Beta-blockers (e.g., propranolol): may cause paradoxical hypertension
- Alpha-blockers (e.g., prazosin, phenothiazines)
- Halogenated anesthetics: increase risk of arrhythmias
- Alkaline solutions (e.g., sodium bicarbonate): inactivate adrenaline

May decrease plasma potassium, magnesium, and vitamin C levels. Interferes with blood sugar control in diabetic patients.

 Pregnancy:
- Category C
- Crosses placenta; may cause fetal tachycardia, arrhythmia, and reduced uterine blood flow
