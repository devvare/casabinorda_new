 NEOTIGASON (Acitretin) 25 mg – PRODUCT INFORMATION

 1. Product Description

NEOTIGASON® 25 mg capsules contain the active ingredient acitretin, a systemic retinoid derived from vitamin A. Acitretin is used in the management of severe skin disorders involving abnormal keratinization. It works by normalizing the growth and differentiation of skin cells.

NEOTIGASON is produced under strict pharmaceutical standards and distributed globally via regulated wholesale networks. In many countries, its distribution requires special authorization, and it is commonly involved in import or export operations under the supervision of national health authorities.

Each capsule contains:
- Active substance: Acitretin 25 mg
- Excipients: Glucose, sodium ascorbate, microcrystalline cellulose, gelatin, titanium dioxide, and iron oxides

The capsules are presented with a brown cap and yellow body, printed with “25” in black.

NEOTIGASON is indicated for the treatment of:
- Severe psoriasis, including erythrodermic and pustular types
