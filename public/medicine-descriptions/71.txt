 4. CONTRAINDICATIONS  
- Abnormalities of the esophagus (stricture, achalasia)  
- Inability to sit/stand upright ≥ 30 minutes  
- Hypocalcemia  
- Hypersensitivity to alendronate or any excipient  

 5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  
5.1 Upper GI Adverse Reactions  
- Risk of esophagitis, ulcers, erosions; instruct proper dosing and discontinue if dysphagia, odynophagia, or retrosternal pain occur.

5.2 Mineral Metabolism  
- Correct hypocalcemia and vitamin D deficiency before initiating; monitor in high‑risk patients.

5.3 Musculoskeletal Pain  
- Severe bone, joint, or muscle pain reported; discontinue if severe symptoms develop.

5.4 Osteonecrosis of the Jaw  
- Reported in oncology and osteoporosis patients; risk factors include dental extractions, poor oral hygiene, corticosteroids, chemotherapy. Consider dental exam prior to therapy; avoid invasive dental procedures if possible.

5.5 Atypical Femur Fractures  
- Subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures reported with long‑term use; investigate thigh or groin pain and consider discontinuation pending risk/benefit assessment.

5.6 Renal Impairment  
- Not recommended if creatinine clearance < 35 mL/min.

 6. ADVERSE REACTIONS  
6.1 Clinical Trials Experience  
- Most common (≥ 3%): abdominal pain, acid regurgitation, constipation, diarrhea, dyspepsia, musculoskeletal pain, nausea.  
- Other: headache, dizziness, flatulence, rash, back pain, peripheral edema.  

6.2 Post‑marketing  
- Hypersensitivity (urticaria, angioedema), transient acute‑phase reactions (fever, myalgia), symptomatic hypocalcemia, esophageal perforation, Stevens–Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, osteonecrosis of the jaw, atypical fractures, uveitis/episcleritis.

 7. DRUG INTERACTIONS  
- Calcium, antacids, multivalent cations: interfere with absorption; separate by ≥ 30 minutes.  
- NSAIDs/aspirin: may increase GI irritation; use caution.

 8. USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS  
8.1 Pregnancy  
- Discontinue when pregnancy recognized; animal data show fetal skeletal toxicity at ≥ 0.1× human dose citeturn1file0.  

8.2 Lactation  
- Unknown if excreted in human milk; weigh benefits vs. risks.

8.4 Pediatric Use  
- Not indicated; in osteogenesis imperfecta, increased vomiting and acute‑phase reactions occurred without fracture reduction.

8.5 Geriatric Use  
- No overall differences in safety or efficacy in patients ≥ 65 years.

8.6 Renal Impairment  
- Not recommended if creatinine clearance < 35 mL/min; no adjustment needed 35–60 mL/min.

8.7 Hepatic Impairment  
- No dosage adjustment necessary.

 10. OVERDOSAGE  
- Hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, severe GI irritation.  
- Treat with milk or antacids; keep patient upright; do not induce vomiting. Dialysis not effective.

 11. DESCRIPTION  
- Alendronate sodium: (4‑amino‑1‑hydroxybutylidene) bisphosphonic acid monosodium trihydrate; C₄H₁₂NNaO₇P₂·3H₂O; formula weight 325.12. Inactive ingredients: microcrystalline cellulose, lactose anhydrous, croscarmellose sodium, magnesium stearate.

 12. CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY  
12.1 Mechanism of Action  
- Inhibits osteoclast‑mediated bone resorption by binding to bone hydroxyapatite.  

12.2 Pharmacodynamics  
- Reduces biochemical markers of bone turnover by 50–70% (e.g., urinary N‑telopeptides).  

12.3 Pharmacokinetics  
- Oral bioavailability 0.6% fasting; decreased by 60% if taken with coffee or orange juice; negligible if taken with food; protein binding ~78%; terminal half‑life > 10 years due to bone retention; 50% excreted unchanged in urine within 72 hours.

 13. NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY  
13.1 Carcinogenesis/Mutagenesis/Impairment of Fertility  
- No genotoxicity; rodent studies: high‑dose Harderian gland and thyroid adenomas; relevance to humans unknown.

 14. CLINICAL STUDIES  
- Postmenopausal osteoporosis: 10 mg daily reduced vertebral fractures by 48% and hip fractures by 51% over 3 years citeturn1file0.  
- Prevention: 5 mg daily increased BMD vs. placebo over 2–3 years.  
- Men: 10 mg daily increased BMD and bone markers.  
- Glucocorticoid‑induced: 5 mg daily prevented bone loss vs. placebo in 1 year.  
- Paget’s disease: 40 mg daily for 6 months normalized alkaline phosphatase in 70% of patients.

 16. HOW SUPPLIED/STORAGE AND HANDLING  
- NDC: specific codes for 70 mg tablets in bottles of 4.  
- Store at 20–25 °C; protect from moisture.

 17. PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION  
- Emphasize dosing instructions (upright posture, fasting).  
- Discuss calcium/vitamin D supplementation.  
- Warn about potential for GI irritation and jaw osteonecrosis; advise dental evaluation.  
- Advise prompt reporting of thigh/groin pain.
