 VERZENIOS 50 mg 42 Film-Coated Tablets Product Information

VERZENIOS (abemaciclib) 50 mg film-coated tablets are a targeted oral cancer therapy developed for treating specific types of breast cancer. Manufactured by Eli Lilly, this product is available in multiple tablet strengths, with the 50 mg formulation commonly used for dose adjustments or tolerability purposes within multi-strength treatment regimens.

As a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4 & 6 inhibitor, abemaciclib works by interfering with cancer cell growth and division. This mode of action has made it a pivotal component in hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer treatment protocols—both for early and advanced stages.



 Pharmaceutical Composition and Appearance

Each VERZENIOS 50 mg tablet contains 50 mg of abemaciclib, along with pharmaceutical excipients like lactose monohydrate, microcrystalline cellulose, and iron oxide colorants. These beige, oval-shaped tablets are debossed with “Lilly” on one side and “50” on the other, ensuring easy identification in a clinical setting.

The tablets are available in blister packs of 42 film-coated tablets, a common unit for monthly treatment supplies, facilitating convenient handling for pharmacies and hospitals.



 Therapeutic Indications

VERZENIOS is indicated for:

- Early breast cancer: As adjuvant therapy in combination with endocrine treatment for hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative node-positive patients at high risk of recurrence.
- Advanced or metastatic breast cancer: As initial or subsequent therapy in combination with an aromatase inhibitor or fulvestrant for patients who have progressed on prior endocrine therapy.

In both premenopausal and perimenopausal women, VERZENIOS should be used alongside a luteinising hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist.



 Dosage and Administration

The standard dosage of VERZENIOS when used in combination therapy is 150 mg twice daily. However, the 50 mg tablet is essential for dose adjustments in response to adverse effects or specific patient needs.

Doses should be taken at the same time each day, with or without food. Tablets must be swallowed whole—not crushed, chewed, or split.

Healthcare providers are advised to monitor patients closely for side effects like diarrhoea, neutropenia, and elevated liver enzymes, and adjust dosing accordingly. Detailed guidance on dose modification based on severity is included in the Summary of Product Characteristics.



 Pharmacological Properties

Abemaciclib targets CDK4 and CDK6, proteins involved in regulating cell cycle progression. By blocking these enzymes, VERZENIOS halts the proliferation of cancer cells in the G1 phase, preventing tumor progression.

In clinical trials (e.g., monarchE, MONARCH 2, and MONARCH 3), VERZENIOS demonstrated:

- Improved invasive disease-free survival in early-stage breast cancer
- Prolonged progression-free survival in metastatic settings
- Manageable safety profile when used with endocrine therapy

These results reinforce its growing role in long-term breast cancer management.



 Safety Profile and Adverse Reactions

Common adverse reactions include:

- Diarrhoea
- Fatigue
- Neutropenia
- Infections
- Elevated ALT/AST

These are typically manageable through supportive care and dose reductions. Regular blood tests and liver function monitoring are recommended throughout treatment.

Patients should avoid grapefruit or grapefruit juice, which can interact with the medication's metabolism via CYP3A4 enzyme pathways.



 Storage and Handling

- Shelf life: 3 years
- Storage: No special conditions required
- Packaging: Child-resistant blister packs with day-of-week labeling

Pharmacies and distributors should store the product in accordance with pharmaceutical safety protocols to ensure quality and efficacy.
