 ASPIRIN 500 MG TABLET – PRODUCT INFORMATION

 1. Product Overview

ASPIRIN® 500 mg is a well-established pharmaceutical product containing 500 mg of acetylsalicylic acid per tablet. It is part of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) class and is widely used for its analgesic (pain-relieving), antipyretic (fever-reducing), and anti-inflammatory properties.

Each box typically contains 20 white, round, biconvex tablets, with “BAYER” embossed on one side and “ASPIRIN 0.5” on the other. The product is available by prescription and over the counter, depending on the indication and local regulations.

- Headache
- Toothache
- Menstrual pain
- Muscle and joint pain
- Back pain and lumbago
- Fever associated with colds and flu
- Inflammatory conditions

It is not suitable for use in viral infections in children or adolescents due to the risk of Reye's syndrome, a rare but serious condition.

 5. Warnings and Precautions

 Caution is advised in patients with:

- History of gastrointestinal ulcers or bleeding
- Asthma or other respiratory conditions
- Liver or kidney dysfunction
- Bleeding tendencies or use of anticoagulants

Aspirin may prolong bleeding time and interfere with platelet function. It should be discontinued before surgeries, including dental procedures. Use of other NSAIDs concurrently should be avoided.

 6. Use in Pregnancy and Lactation

 Pregnancy:
- Aspirin should not be used during the last trimester due to the risk of fetal cardiovascular complications and prolonged labor.
- During the first and second trimesters, it should only be used if absolutely necessary under medical supervision.

 Breastfeeding:
- Small amounts may pass into breast milk. Though harmful effects are rare, long-term or high-dose use is discouraged while nursing.

 7. Drug Interactions

Aspirin interacts with several medications:

- Anticoagulants and antiplatelet drugs (e.g., warfarin, clopidogrel) – increased bleeding risk
- NSAIDs and corticosteroids – higher risk of gastrointestinal side effects
- Methotrexate – toxicity may be increased
- Diuretics, ACE inhibitors – reduced effectiveness
- Insulin and sulfonylureas – potential enhancement of hypoglycemic effects
- Probenecid, benzbromarone – reduced uricosuric effect
- Valproic acid – increased plasma concentration
- Alcohol – increases risk of gastrointestinal bleeding

Patients should inform their healthcare providers of all medications they use, including over-the-counter and herbal supplements.
