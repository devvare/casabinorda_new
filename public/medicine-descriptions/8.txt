 ABITIGA-250 MG 120 Film-Coated Tablets Product Information

ABITIGA 250 mg film-coated tablets are a therapeutic innovation designed for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer in adult men. Each tablet contains 250 mg of abiraterone acetate, a potent inhibitor of androgen biosynthesis. Developed to suppress testosterone production, ABITIGA helps to slow down the growth and spread of prostate cancer cells.

Manufactured by Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. and available in bottles of 120 tablets, this product is intended for oral use and is a key treatment option within global pharmaceutical oncology protocols.



 Composition and Pharmaceutical Form

Each ABITIGA tablet contains:
- Active ingredient: Abiraterone acetate (250 mg per tablet)
- Excipients: Microcrystalline cellulose, lactose monohydrate, povidone, sodium lauryl sulfate, and titanium dioxide among others

The tablets are white, oval, and film-coated with "TEVA" on one side and "1125" on the other. They are delivered in plastic bottles with child-resistant caps, optimized for secure and extended use in both hospital and outpatient settings.



 Therapeutic Indication

ABITIGA is indicated for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). It is administered in combination with prednisone or prednisolone and is used in the following patient groups:
- Men who have not yet received chemotherapy
- Patients unfit for chemotherapy
- Those who have previously undergone chemotherapy but experienced disease recurrence

The therapy helps control cancer progression by blocking androgen production at all three sources: testes, adrenal glands, and the tumor itself. It must always be used with a corticosteroid to manage the risk of hypertension, hypokalemia, and fluid retention.



 Administration and Dosage

The recommended dosage is 1,000 mg per day, taken as four 250 mg tablets once daily, on an empty stomach. It is crucial that:
- ABITIGA is not taken with food as this can increase systemic exposure and risk of adverse effects.
- Doses are taken at least one hour before or two hours after meals.
- Tablets are swallowed whole with water, without crushing or splitting.

This treatment must be co-administered with prednisone or prednisolone as per your doctor’s instructions.



 Clinical Use and Safety Monitoring

ABITIGA is typically prescribed and monitored by oncologists or healthcare professionals experienced in managing advanced prostate cancer. Before initiating treatment, patients are evaluated for liver function, cardiovascular conditions, and blood potassium levels. Monitoring continues throughout therapy to detect potential complications such as:
- Elevated liver enzymes (ALT, AST)
- Electrolyte imbalances (notably low potassium)
- Fluid retention and cardiac disorders

In cases of hepatic impairment, dosage adjustment or treatment suspension may be required. The drug is not recommended for patients with severe liver dysfunction.



 Adverse Reactions

The most common side effects reported during treatment with ABITIGA include:
- Very common: High blood pressure, urinary tract infections, low potassium levels, elevated liver enzymes, and swelling in the legs or feet
- Common: Heart palpitations, chest pain, arrhythmia, bone fractures, indigestion, and rash
- Less common: Adrenal gland disorders, muscle weakness, allergic reactions
- Rare: Acute liver failure and lung inflammation (allergic alveolitis)

Patients are advised to report any signs of yellowing of the skin, shortness of breath, or severe fatigue, which may be symptoms of serious complications.
