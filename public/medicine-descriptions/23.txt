 MUCOLATOR 200 MG 150 ML – PRODUCT INFORMATION

 Product Description

MUCOLATOR® 200 mg/5 mL is a powder intended for oral syrup preparation, used in the treatment of respiratory conditions associated with excessive or viscous mucus. Each 5 mL of the reconstituted syrup contains 200 mg of acetylcysteine, a mucolytic agent that decreases mucus viscosity and promotes its clearance from the airways.

The powder is light yellow in color and becomes an orange-flavored, translucent syrup upon reconstitution. The product is supplied in amber glass bottles marked for 150 mL volume, containing 60 grams of powder, and includes a calibrated dosing spoon marked for 2.5 mL, 5 mL, and 10 mL.

 Composition

 Active ingredient:
- Acetylcysteine – 200 mg per 5 mL

 Excipients:
- Sucrose – 680 mg
- Sorbitol (E420) – 992 mg
- Methylparahydroxybenzoate sodium (E219)
- Propylparahydroxybenzoate sodium (E217)
- Citric acid anhydrous, ethyl maltol, glycine, beta-carotene (E160), and orange flavor

 Therapeutic Indications

MUCOLATOR is used in:
- Respiratory disorders requiring the reduction and removal of thick mucus (e.g., bronchitis, COPD, cystic fibrosis, and bronchiectasis)
- Prevention of hepatic damage in patients with paracetamol (acetaminophen) overdose

The dual action of acetylcysteine—mucolytic and hepatoprotective—makes MUCOLATOR a valuable treatment option in both respiratory and emergency toxicological settings.

| >7 years & Adults | 5 mL (1 spoon) | Three times daily | 600 mg/day |

For paracetamol poisoning, the recommended loading dose is 140 mg/kg followed by 70 mg/kg every 4 hours for 17 doses.

3. Refill to the line again and shake until fully dissolved.
4. The final syrup is orange-flavored and semi-transparent.

 Contraindications

MUCOLATOR is contraindicated in patients with:
- Known hypersensitivity to acetylcysteine or any of the excipients
- Severe liver impairment (Child-Pugh Class C)
- Risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, such as peptic ulcers or esophageal varices
- Bronchospasm history without medical supervision

MUCOLATOR should not be administered to children under 2 years unless under strict medical guidance.

 Warnings and Precautions

- Increased mucus secretion may occur. Patients with impaired cough reflex or airway clearance should be monitored.
- Asthmatics should avoid inhaling the powder during preparation due to bronchospasm risk.
- Discontinue if symptoms of Stevens-Johnson Syndrome or Lyell's Syndrome (severe skin reactions) appear.
- Caution in patients with peptic ulcers, renal insufficiency, or those prone to bleeding.
- May cause gastrointestinal irritation, vomiting, and rare allergic reactions.

 Drug Interactions

- Antitussives: May suppress the cough reflex, leading to mucus accumulation. Avoid unless clinically justified.
- Antibiotics (e.g., aminoglycosides, cephalosporins): Interactions may occur due to free sulfhydryl groups; administer at least 2 hours apart.
- Nitroglycerin: Co-administration may enhance vasodilatory and antiplatelet effects.
- Carbamazepine: Acetylcysteine may reduce serum levels, potentially lowering seizure threshold.
- Activated charcoal: Reduces acetylcysteine absorption and should not be used concurrently.

 Use in Specific Populations

 Pregnancy:
- Classified as Category B
- Animal studies show no teratogenicity
- Limited human data; use only if benefit outweighs risk

 Lactation:
- Unknown if acetylcysteine passes into breast milk
- Use with caution and only if medically necessary

 Pediatric:
- Safe above 2 years of age
- Infants under 1 year: only in life-threatening cases under supervision

 Geriatric:
- Use with caution; no specific clinical data available

 Adverse Reactions

 Common (≥1/100 to <1/10):
- Rash, urticaria
- Gastrointestinal discomfort: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea

 Uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100):
- Bronchospasm, particularly in asthmatics
- Headache, dizziness
- Allergic reactions including itching, flushing

 Rare (<1/10,000):
- Anaphylaxis
- Stevens-Johnson Syndrome
- Bleeding events due to reduced platelet aggregation

All adverse reactions should be reported to the national pharmacovigilance center for ongoing monitoring.

 Overdose

Toxicity is rare. Clinical trials show doses up to 11.6 g/day are well-tolerated.

Symptoms: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, potential risk of increased mucus in infants.

Treatment: Supportive and symptomatic care. No specific antidote is required for acetylcysteine overdose unless IV administration is involved.

 Storage and Shelf Life
