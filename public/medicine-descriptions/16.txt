 BIOFENAC 100 MG 20 TAB – PRODUCT INFORMATION

 Product Overview

BIOFENAC® 100 mg film-coated tablets contain aceclofenac, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) primarily used to relieve pain and inflammation. Each tablet delivers 100 mg of the active ingredient and is designed for oral administration.

BIOFENAC is marketed by EİP Eczacıbaşı İlaç Pazarlama A.Ş., licensed by Almirall S.A., Barcelona, Spain, and manufactured at Industrias Farmacéuticas Almirall S.A.. As a recognized pharmaceutical product, it is commonly prescribed for a wide range of musculoskeletal and inflammatory disorders.

 Therapeutic Indications

BIOFENAC® is indicated for the treatment of various conditions characterized by pain and inflammation, including:

- Osteoarthritis (degenerative joint disease)
- Rheumatoid arthritis (chronic inflammatory disorder)
- Ankylosing spondylitis (a type of spinal arthritis)
- Acute gout arthritis
- Postoperative pain (following dental or orthopedic surgery)
- Painful menstrual periods (dysmenorrhea)
- Musculoskeletal pain

Its analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties make it an effective choice for managing both acute and chronic symptoms.

 Dosage and Administration

 Standard Adult Dose:
- One tablet twice daily (morning and evening)
- It should preferably be taken with or after meals to reduce gastrointestinal side effects.

Tablets must be swallowed whole with a glass of water. They should not be chewed or broken.

 Special Populations:
- Elderly: May be more sensitive to side effects; monitor closely.
- Hepatic impairment: Begin treatment at a reduced dose (100 mg once daily).
- Renal impairment: Use with caution; no adjustment for mild cases.

BIOFENAC is not recommended for children under 18 years, due to a lack of safety and efficacy data.

 Warnings and Precautions

 Cardiovascular Risk:
Prolonged use of NSAIDs, including aceclofenac, may increase the risk of heart attack or stroke. This risk is greater in individuals with existing cardiovascular conditions or risk factors like smoking, high cholesterol, or hypertension.

 Gastrointestinal Risk:
NSAIDs may cause severe gastrointestinal side effects, such as bleeding, ulceration, or perforation. Elderly patients are especially at risk. Patients with prior GI disorders should be closely monitored and may be prescribed protective medications (e.g., proton pump inhibitors).

 Renal and Hepatic Concerns:
BIOFENAC can adversely affect kidney and liver function, particularly in long-term use. Periodic monitoring of renal and hepatic markers is recommended during treatment.

BIOFENAC® may interact with the following medications:

- Anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin)
- Antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin)
- Corticosteroids
- SSRIs (e.g., fluoxetine)
- Diuretics and antihypertensives
- Methotrexate
- Cyclosporine
- Lithium

Always inform your healthcare provider about any medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements.

 Use in Pregnancy and Lactation

BIOFENAC is classified as Pregnancy Category C and should not be used during the third trimester, due to potential harm to the fetus and interference with labor. There is insufficient information on its safety during breastfeeding; thus, it is not recommended for nursing mothers unless deemed necessary by a physician.
