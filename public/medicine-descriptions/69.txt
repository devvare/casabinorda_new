 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS  

 4.1 Therapeutic Indications  
- Treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis in women at risk of vitamin D insufficiency.  
- Reduces the risk of vertebral and hip fractures.

 4.2 Posology and Method of Administration  

Recommended dose: one tablet once weekly.  
- If a dose is missed, take one tablet the next morning—do not take two tablets the same day.  
- Long‑term use is expected; reassess need after 5 years based on individual risk/benefit.  
- Ensure adequate dietary calcium; consider additional vitamin D supplementation as needed.

Special populations:  
- Elderly: no dosage adjustment required.  
- Renal impairment: not recommended if creatinine clearance < 35 mL/min; no adjustment needed > 35 mL/min.  
- Paediatrics (< 18 years): not established; not recommended.

Administration instructions to optimize absorption & reduce oesophageal irritation:  
1. Take upon rising, with ≥ 200 mL plain water (no mineral water), ≥ 30 minutes before any food, drink or other medication.  
2. Swallow whole—do not crush, chew or dissolve.  
3. Remain upright (sitting, standing or walking) for at least 30 minutes post‑dose and until after first meal.  
4. Do not take at bedtime or before arising.

 4.3 Contraindications  
- Hypersensitivity to alendronate, cholecalciferol or excipients.  
- Oesophageal abnormalities delaying emptying (e.g., stricture, achalasia).  
- Inability to stand/sit upright for ≥ 30 minutes.  
- Hypocalcaemia.

 4.4 Special Warnings and Precautions for Use  

Upper gastrointestinal:  
- Risk of oesophagitis, oesophageal ulcers/erosions—ensure proper dosing procedure; discontinue if symptoms (dysphagia, odynophagia, retrosternal pain) occur.  

Bone-related events:  
- Osteonecrosis of the jaw: report oral symptoms (pain, swelling, loose teeth); consider dental exam before bisphosphonate therapy in high‑risk patients.  
- Atypical femoral fractures: may occur after minimal/no trauma—advise patients to report thigh/hip/groin pain.  
- Musculoskeletal pain: severe bone, joint or muscle pain has been reported.

Mineral metabolism:  
- Correct hypocalcaemia, vitamin D deficiency, or hypoparathyroidism before initiation.  
- Monitor serum calcium in patients with malabsorption or diseases with overproduction of calcitriol (e.g., sarcoidosis).  

Renal:  
- Avoid if creatinine clearance < 35 mL/min.

Excipients:  
- Contains lactose and sucrose; not suitable for those with rare sugar intolerances.

 4.5 Interaction with Other Medicinal Products  
- Concomitant calcium supplements, antacids and other oral meds interfere with alendronate absorption—observe 30‑minute gap.  
- NSAIDs may increase gastrointestinal irritation.  
- Olestra, mineral oils, orlistat or bile acid sequestrants impair vitamin D absorption; anticonvulsants, cimetidine, thiazides may increase vitamin D catabolism.

 4.6 Fertility, Pregnancy and Lactation  
- Intended only for postmenopausal women; contraindicated in pregnancy and breastfeeding.

 4.7 Effects on Ability to Drive and Use Machines  
- Has no or negligible influence; however, dizziness, blurred vision or severe pain may impair ability—exercise caution.

 4.8 Undesirable Effects  

Very common (≥ 1/10):  
- Musculoskeletal pain (bone, muscle, joint), sometimes severe.  

Common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10):  
- Gastrointestinal: abdominal pain, dyspepsia, constipation, diarrhoea, flatulence, acid regurgitation.  
- Immune: headaches, dizziness, alopecia, pruritus, asthenia, peripheral oedema, joint swelling.  

Uncommon (≥ 1/1 000 to < 1/100):  
- Nausea, vomiting, gastritis, oesophagitis, eye inflammation, rash.  

Rare (≥ 1/10 000 to < 1/1 000):  
- Hypersensitivity (urticaria, angioedema), symptomatic hypocalcaemia, peptic ulcers, oesophageal stricture, Stevens–Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, osteonecrosis of jaw, atypical femoral fractures.  

Very rare (< 1/10 000):  
- Osteonecrosis of external auditory canal.

 4.9 Overdose  
- Alendronate overdose: hypocalcaemia, upper GI irritation; treat with milk/antacids, do not induce vomiting, keep patient upright.  
- Cholecalciferol: toxicity unlikely at ≤ 10 000 IU/day in healthy adults.

 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES  

 5.1 Pharmacodynamic Properties  
Alendronate: bisphosphonate inhibiting osteoclast‑mediated bone resorption.  
Cholecalciferol: vitamin D₃ precursor, enhances intestinal calcium/phosphate absorption and bone mineralisation.

Key clinical studies showed weekly alendronate 70 mg + Vitamin D₃ improved BMD and reduced vertebral/hip fractures versus placebo and alendronate alone, and corrected vitamin D insufficiency over 15–24 weeks.

 5.2 Pharmacokinetic Properties  
- Alendronate bioavailability: ~ 0.6% fasting; negligible with food. Terminal half‑life > 10 years due to bone retention.  
- Vitamin D₃ absorption: Tmax ~ 10–12 hours; half‑life ~ 24 hours; similar bioavailability alone or in combination.

 5.3 Preclinical Safety Data  
- No special hazard beyond class effects; animal studies indicate reproductive toxicity at high doses.
