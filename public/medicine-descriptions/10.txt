 ZYTIGA-250 MG 120 Film-Coated Tablets Product Information

ZYTIGA® (abiraterone acetate) 250 mg film-coated tablets are an advanced oral hormone therapy used in the treatment of prostate cancer. Each tablet contains 250 mg of abiraterone acetate, a prodrug that converts in the body to abiraterone, an inhibitor of androgen biosynthesis. Manufactured under strict pharmaceutical quality standards, ZYTIGA is prescribed in combination with corticosteroids such as prednisone or prednisolone and is available in bottles containing 120 tablets, ideal for monthly treatment cycles.

ZYTIGA is marketed by Janssen-Cilag International NV, a trusted name in oncology therapeutics. This product plays a central role in both early and advanced stages of metastatic prostate cancer, making it a top choice for oncology specialists and institutions worldwide.



 Therapeutic Indications

ZYTIGA is indicated in combination with prednisone or prednisolone for the treatment of:

- Newly diagnosed high-risk metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) in combination with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).
- Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) in adult men who are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic after failure of ADT and for whom chemotherapy is not yet indicated.
- mCRPC in patients who have progressed on or after a docetaxel-based chemotherapy regimen.

In all cases, ZYTIGA should be co-administered with ongoing medical castration via LHRH analogues unless the patient has undergone surgical castration.



 Pharmaceutical Form and Appearance

ZYTIGA 250 mg tablets are white to off-white, oval-shaped, and debossed with “AA250” on one side. Each tablet contains 250 mg of abiraterone acetate, equivalent to 223 mg of abiraterone, and includes excipients like lactose monohydrate and sodium lauryl sulfate.

Each unit contains 120 film-coated tablets in HDPE bottles with child-resistant closures, suitable for use in hospital and outpatient settings. This packaging format is optimal for pharmaceutical wholesale distribution and regulated import/export logistics.



 Dosage and Administration

The recommended dose is 1,000 mg daily, taken as four 250 mg tablets in a single dose, ideally at the same time each day. Critical instructions include:

- Take on an empty stomach—at least two hours after food and wait at least one hour before eating again.
- Tablets must be swallowed whole with water; do not crush or chew.
- Administer with prednisone or prednisolone (5–10 mg daily depending on indication) to mitigate side effects related to increased mineralocorticoid levels.



 Mechanism of Action

Abiraterone acetate inhibits CYP17, an enzyme crucial for androgen biosynthesis. It blocks testosterone production not only in the testes but also in adrenal glands and prostate tumors. Lowering androgen levels helps slow the progression of prostate cancer.

Clinical trials (Studies 301, 302, and 3011) have demonstrated that ZYTIGA significantly prolongs radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) and overall survival (OS) in both chemotherapy-naive and previously treated patients.



 Efficacy Highlights

- In newly diagnosed high-risk mHSPC, ZYTIGA improved median rPFS from 14.78 to 33.02 months and OS from 36.5 to 53.3 months.
- In chemotherapy-naïve mCRPC, ZYTIGA extended rPFS from 8.3 to 16.5 months and delayed the need for cytotoxic chemotherapy.
- Patients with prior chemotherapy saw median OS increase from 10.9 to 14.8 months, with significant improvements in pain management and quality of life.



 Safety and Monitoring

Common side effects include:
- Hypertension
- Hypokalemia
- Fluid retention
- Liver enzyme elevations
- Urinary tract infections

Routine monitoring includes liver function tests, serum potassium, and blood pressure. In cases of hepatotoxicity, temporary dose suspension or reduction is necessary. Patients with severe hepatic impairment must not use ZYTIGA.

Caution is advised in patients with a history of cardiovascular disease or those at risk for heart failure, as ZYTIGA can exacerbate these conditions.



 Contraindications

- Hypersensitivity to abiraterone or excipients
- Severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C)
- Women who are or may become pregnant
- Use in combination with Ra-223 (due to increased fracture risk)



 Storage and Handling

- No special storage conditions required
- Store in original packaging to protect from moisture
- Keep out of reach of children
- Dispose of unused tablets per local environmental regulations

Healthcare personnel handling ZYTIGA should use gloves if pregnant or potentially pregnant, due to risks to the developing fetus.
