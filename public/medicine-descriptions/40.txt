 DUACT (Acrivastine + Pseudoephedrine Hydrochloride) – PRODUCT INFORMATION

 Product Overview

DUACT is an oral combination medicine containing two active ingredients: acrivastine (8 mg) and pseudoephedrine hydrochloride (60 mg) per capsule. This medication is used to relieve symptoms associated with allergic rhinitis, particularly when nasal congestion is present. DUACT works by combining the effects of an antihistamine and a decongestant. Acrivastine helps relieve sneezing, runny nose, and itching, while pseudoephedrine alleviates nasal congestion by constricting the blood vessels in the nasal passages.

It is available in blister packs of 30 capsules, manufactured by Abdi İbrahim İlaç San. ve Tic. A.Ş. and licensed by GlaxoSmithKline İlaçları San. ve Tic. A.Ş. DUACT is distributed through authorized pharmaceutical channels and may be included in international import and export systems, especially in regions with high seasonal allergy prevalence.
