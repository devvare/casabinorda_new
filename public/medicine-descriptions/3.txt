ORENCIA 250 mg Powder for Concentrate for Solution for Infusion – Pharmaceutical Overview

**ORENCIA (abatacept)** is a biologic medicinal product offered as a **250 mg powder** for concentrate for solution for infusion. Designed to provide therapeutic relief for patients suffering from autoimmune conditions such as **rheumatoid arthritis (RA)**, **psoriatic arthritis (PsA)**, and **polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA)**, ORENCIA represents a cutting-edge solution in immunosuppressive therapy.

This medication belongs to the class of **selective immunosuppressants**, specifically designed to modulate immune system activity and reduce inflammation. It works by targeting T-cell activation, a crucial mechanism in the autoimmune cascade, through its fusion protein structure derived from **CTLA-4** linked to a modified Fc portion of human IgG1.

### Composition and Presentation

Each vial of ORENCIA contains **250 mg of abatacept**, which becomes 25 mg/mL after reconstitution. The powder appears white to off-white and forms a whole or fragmented cake. It is produced via recombinant DNA technology in Chinese hamster ovary cells, ensuring high quality and consistency in pharmaceutical manufacturing.

### Indications

ORENCIA is indicated for:

- Adults with **moderate to severe RA**, especially those unresponsive to methotrexate or TNF-alpha inhibitors.
- Adults with **highly active and progressive RA** who are naïve to methotrexate.
- Adults with **active PsA**, alone or in combination with methotrexate, when other DMARDs fail.
- Children aged 6 years and above with **moderate to severe pJIA**, as monotherapy or with methotrexate.

The product is administered intravenously over 30 minutes at doses dependent on body weight, typically repeated every four weeks after initial dosing at weeks 0, 2, and 4.
