 AKLOVIR (Acyclovir) 200 mg 25 Tablets – PRODUCT INFORMATION

 1. Product Overview

AKLOVIR® 200 mg tablets are an orally administered antiviral medication containing acyclovir, a synthetic purine nucleoside analogue with potent inhibitory effects against Herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2, Varicella zoster virus (VZV), and other human herpesviruses. Each tablet is designed to manage both the treatment and prevention of herpesvirus-related infections.

AKLOVIR is presented as white, round, scored tablets, packaged in blister packs of 25 tablets. The product is manufactured under strict pharmaceutical quality control standards and is made available to hospitals and pharmacies through licensed wholesale channels. Depending on regulatory requirements, it may also be subject to import or export permissions in international trade. 



 2. Composition

Active ingredient:  
- Acyclovir 200 mg per tablet

Excipients include:  
- Lactose monohydrate  
- Sodium starch glycolate  
- Microcrystalline cellulose  
- Magnesium stearate  
- Copovidone  

These components help ensure the tablet’s stability and bioavailability.



 3. Indications

AKLOVIR is indicated for:
- Treatment of Herpes simplex virus infections (primary and recurrent), including genital herpes
- Suppression of recurrent HSV infections in immunocompetent individuals
- Prophylaxis of HSV in immunocompromised patients (e.g., transplant recipients, HIV patients)
- Treatment of varicella (chickenpox) and herpes zoster (shingles)

Early initiation of treatment, particularly for shingles, has been shown to reduce the incidence of post-herpetic neuralgia and hasten symptom resolution.



 4. Dosage and Administration

 Adults:

- HSV Treatment: 200 mg (1 tablet) five times daily at 4-hour intervals, omitting the night dose, for 5 days. Treatment may be extended in severe infections. In immunocompromised patients or those with malabsorption, 400 mg five times a day or intravenous therapy may be required.
  
- HSV Suppression: 200 mg four times daily at 6-hour intervals. Alternatively, 400 mg twice daily may be effective. Therapy should be reviewed every 6–12 months.

- HSV Prophylaxis (immunocompromised): 200 mg four times daily; may increase to 400 mg in some cases.

- Varicella and Herpes Zoster: 800 mg (4 tablets) five times a day for 7 days. Early initiation provides better outcomes.

 Children:

- HSV Treatment and Prophylaxis:  
  - ≥2 years: Adult dose  
  - <2 years: Half of the adult dose  
- Varicella:  
  - >6 years: 800 mg four times daily  
  - 2–6 years: 400 mg four times daily  
  - <2 years: 200 mg four times daily or 20 mg/kg up to a maximum of 800 mg/day

 Elderly Patients:

- Dose adjustment may be required due to decreased renal function.
- Hydration must be maintained to prevent renal complications.

 Renal Impairment:

- Mild to moderate impairment: No major adjustments for HSV; monitor closely.  
- Severe impairment (CrCl <10 mL/min): 200 mg every 12 hours (HSV); 800 mg every 12 hours (VZV).



 5. Contraindications

AKLOVIR should not be used in patients with:
- Known hypersensitivity to acyclovir, valacyclovir, or any excipient in the formulation
- Rare hereditary conditions such as galactose intolerance, Lapp lactase deficiency, or glucose-galactose malabsorption



 6. Warnings and Precautions

- Hydration is essential, especially in elderly patients and those receiving high doses.
- Neurological side effects, including confusion or hallucinations, have been reported, particularly in patients with renal impairment or those receiving excessive doses.
- Patients should be advised on preventing transmission, especially during active lesions.
- Contains lactose: caution in lactose-intolerant individuals.



 7. Drug Interactions

- Probenecid and cimetidine can increase acyclovir plasma concentrations by reducing renal clearance.
- Mycophenolate mofetil in transplant patients may have additive plasma exposure effects.
- No dose adjustment is generally required due to acyclovir’s broad safety margin.



 8. Use in Special Populations

 Pregnancy:
- Category B: Data do not indicate a significant risk to the fetus; however, AKLOVIR should only be used when clearly necessary.

 Breastfeeding:
- Acyclovir is excreted in breast milk at concentrations up to 4.1 times maternal plasma levels. Caution is advised.

 Fertility:
- No adverse impact has been noted on male fertility. Long-term oral use has not shown significant changes in sperm count or morphology.



 9. Adverse Reactions

 Common (≥1/100 to <1/10):
- Headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, fatigue, fever, rash, and itching

 Uncommon to Rare (≥1/1,000 to <1/100):
- Photosensitivity, hair loss, urticaria, dizziness

 Very Rare (<1/10,000):
- Anemia, leukopenia, tremor, ataxia, hallucinations, encephalopathy, hepatitis, renal failure

Symptoms are typically reversible upon discontinuation, especially in cases of renal-related neurotoxicity.



 10. Overdose

- Symptoms: Nausea, vomiting, agitation, hallucinations, renal impairment
- Treatment: Supportive therapy; hemodialysis significantly reduces plasma acyclovir levels and is recommended in severe cases.



 11. Storage and Packaging

- Store below 25°C in a dry location
- Keep out of reach of children
- Do not use beyond the expiration date

Packaging:  
- 25 tablets per blister pack, enclosed in a cardboard carton

AKLOVIR is often available for purchase via hospital procurement systems and licensed wholesale pharmaceutical suppliers. It is not intended for direct consumer buy without prescription. Cross-border import or export may require regulatory clearance in line with local drug control laws.
