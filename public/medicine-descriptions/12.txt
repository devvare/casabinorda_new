 GLUCOBAY 100 MG 30 TAB – PRODUCT INFORMATION

 1. Product Overview

GLUCOBAY® 100 mg is an oral antidiabetic medication primarily used in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Each tablet contains 100 mg of acarbose, an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor. This medication is designed to be taken by mouth and functions by delaying the digestion and absorption of carbohydrates in the small intestine. As a result, it reduces the rise in blood glucose levels that typically follows a meal.

The tablets are round, off-white to yellowish in color, and feature the imprint ‘G 100’ on one side and the Bayer logo on the reverse. GLUCOBAY is packaged in blister packs of 30, 60, or 90 tablets.

 2. Active and Inactive Ingredients

- Active Ingredient: Acarbose 100 mg per tablet.
- Excipients: Microcrystalline cellulose, colloidal anhydrous silica, magnesium stearate, and corn starch.

 3. Indications

GLUCOBAY is indicated for:
- The treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in conjunction with dietary management.
- The prevention of diabetes onset in patients diagnosed with impaired glucose tolerance (also known as prediabetes), when combined with diet and physical activity.

 4. Mechanism of Action

Acarbose, the active substance in GLUCOBAY, inhibits the enzyme alpha-glucosidase located in the brush border of the small intestine. By doing so, it slows the breakdown of complex carbohydrates into glucose, resulting in a delayed and reduced postprandial blood glucose spike. This mechanism aids in the overall glycemic control of diabetic patients.

 5. Dosage and Administration

 Initial Dosage:
- Start with ½ tablet of GLUCOBAY 100 mg (i.e., 50 mg) taken three times daily.

 Maintenance Dosage:
- Dosage can be increased up to 1 tablet (100 mg) three times daily, depending on the patient’s response and tolerance.
- The average daily dosage is typically 300 mg (i.e., one 100 mg tablet three times a day).

 Administration Instructions:
- Tablets should be swallowed with a little liquid just before meals, or chewed with the first bites of food.
- Patients must adhere strictly to a prescribed diabetic diet to achieve optimal therapeutic outcomes and minimize gastrointestinal side effects.

 6. Contraindications

Do not use GLUCOBAY if you:
- Are allergic to acarbose or any of the excipients.
- Have chronic digestive or intestinal conditions (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease, bowel obstruction).
- Suffer from liver cirrhosis.
- Have severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 25 ml/min).
- Are pregnant or breastfeeding.

 7. Special Warnings and Precautions

- Mild increases in liver enzymes (transaminases) may occur. Liver function should be monitored periodically during the first year of treatment.
- Safety and efficacy in children under 18 have not been established; use in this group is not recommended.
- GLUCOBAY should be used with caution in elderly patients, though no dosage adjustment is typically necessary.
- It is not intended for use during pregnancy or lactation.

 8. Interactions with Other Medications

Concurrent use of the following medications may influence the efficacy of GLUCOBAY:
- Antidiabetic agents (e.g., metformin, sulfonylureas, insulin)
- Antacids
- Cholestyramine
- Digestive enzymes
- Neomycin (may enhance gastrointestinal side effects)
- Cardiac drugs such as digoxin

If hypoglycemia occurs when GLUCOBAY is used with other antidiabetic drugs, it should be treated with glucose (dextrose), not sucrose, as sucrose absorption is inhibited.

 9. Side Effects

The most commonly reported side effects are gastrointestinal and include:
- Very common: Flatulence
- Common: Abdominal pain, diarrhea
- Uncommon: Nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia, increased liver enzymes
- Rare: Edema, jaundice
- Very rare/Unknown frequency: Thrombocytopenia, allergic skin reactions (rash, urticaria), bowel obstruction, hepatitis

Note: These effects are more likely to occur or worsen if dietary instructions are not strictly followed.

 10. Overdose and Missed Dose

 Overdose:
- Overconsumption may result in gastrointestinal symptoms like gas and diarrhea, especially if taken with carbohydrate-rich food or drinks.
- In such cases, avoid carbohydrate intake for 4-6 hours post-overdose.

 Missed Dose:
- Do not double the next dose to make up for a missed one. Simply continue with the next scheduled dose.
