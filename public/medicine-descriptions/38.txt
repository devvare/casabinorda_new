 NEOTIGASON (Acitretin) 10 mg 100 Cap – PRODUCT INFORMATION

 Product Overview

NEOTIGASON® 10 mg is a systemic retinoid used for the treatment of severe skin disorders, particularly those involving keratinization. Each capsule contains 10 mg of acitretin, a vitamin A derivative that helps regulate the growth and differentiation of skin cells.

This product is indicated for conditions unresponsive to other conventional therapies, and its use should be supervised by physicians experienced in systemic retinoid treatment. NEOTIGASON is classified as a prescription-only pharmaceutical product, commonly distributed through wholesale channels to pharmacies and hospitals. Its availability in various countries may involve regulated import and export procedures, depending on local laws.



 Composition

Each soft capsule contains:
- Active substance: Acitretin 10 mg
- Excipients: Polysorbate 80, sorbitol, gelatin, glycerol, hydrogenated soybean oil, and coloring agents (including titanium dioxide and yellow iron oxide)



 Pharmaceutical Form

Soft, yellow gelatin capsules for oral administration. Supplied in blister packs of 100 capsules.



 Therapeutic Indications

NEOTIGASON is indicated for the treatment of:
- Severe psoriasis, particularly pustular, erythrodermic, or plaque forms
- Ichthyosis and other disorders of keratinization, including congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma and lamellar ichthyosis
- Lichen planus (hyperkeratotic type)
- Palmoplantar keratoderma
- Darier’s disease (keratosis follicularis)

It is especially effective in cases resistant to other therapies, such as phototherapy, corticosteroids, or immunosuppressants.



 Dosage and Administration

Treatment should be initiated and monitored by a dermatologist or a specialist with experience in retinoid therapy. The dosage must be tailored individually based on the patient’s response and tolerance.

 Adults:
- Starting dose: 25–30 mg per day (2–3 capsules)
- Maintenance dose: 10–20 mg per day (1–2 capsules), adjusted according to clinical improvement and tolerability
- Maximum duration: Long-term therapy should be minimized due to the risk of cumulative toxicity

 Elderly:
No special dosage adjustments are required, but liver and kidney function should be monitored.

 Children:
Not recommended except in severe, life-altering cases of keratinization disorders. Dosage should be based on body weight and closely monitored for skeletal side effects.



 Contraindications

- Pregnancy: NEOTIGASON is highly teratogenic and must not be used during pregnancy or in women of childbearing potential unless strict contraception is followed.
- Breastfeeding
- Severe liver or kidney dysfunction
- Chronic hyperlipidemia
- Hypersensitivity to acitretin, other retinoids, or any excipients
- Concomitant use of methotrexate, tetracyclines, or vitamin A in high doses



 Warnings and Precautions

- Pregnancy Prevention Program: Due to extreme teratogenicity, women of childbearing age must use two reliable forms of contraception starting one month before treatment, throughout therapy, and for at least three years after cessation.
- Frequent liver function tests and lipid profiles are essential during treatment.
- Avoid alcohol consumption, as it may increase the risk of converting acitretin to etretinate, a metabolite with a longer half-life and greater teratogenic risk.
- Monitor bone changes in long-term use, especially in children and elderly patients.
- Avoid donation of blood for transfusion during treatment and for at least three years afterward.



 Interactions

NEOTIGASON may interact with:
- Tetracyclines: Risk of increased intracranial pressure
- Methotrexate and vitamin A derivatives: Enhanced toxicity
- Phenytoin: Potentiated effects
- Alcohol: May lead to the formation of etretinate

Caution is required when combining NEOTIGASON with other hepatotoxic or lipid-altering drugs.
