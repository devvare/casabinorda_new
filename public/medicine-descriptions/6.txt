 VERZENIOS 150 mg – 42 Film-Coated Tablets Product Information

VERZENIOS (active ingredient: abemaciclib) is a targeted oral therapy approved for the treatment of certain types of hormone receptor-positive (HR+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) breast cancer. This innovative therapy belongs to the class of CDK4/6 inhibitors, which work by slowing the progression of cancer cells and preventing their multiplication.

Available in 150 mg film-coated tablets, VERZENIOS is offered in multiple pack sizes including the 42 tablet pack, commonly used in ongoing treatment protocols. The product is manufactured and distributed under strict pharmaceutical quality controls, making it suitable for global therapeutic use and clinical oncology settings.



 Indications and Therapeutic Use

VERZENIOS is prescribed in two major therapeutic scenarios:

1. Early Breast Cancer: In combination with endocrine therapy, it is used for the adjuvant treatment of adults with HR-positive, HER2-negative, node-positive early breast cancer at a high risk of recurrence. For premenopausal and perimenopausal women, it is combined with a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist.

2. Advanced or Metastatic Breast Cancer: VERZENIOS is administered alongside an aromatase inhibitor or fulvestrant. This includes use as initial endocrine-based therapy or following prior endocrine treatment. For pre/perimenopausal women, it is again paired with an LHRH agonist.

The 150 mg dose is typically taken twice daily, with or without food, and continues as long as clinical benefit is observed or until unacceptable toxicity arises.



 Clinical Benefits

VERZENIOS has shown significant improvement in clinical outcomes in pivotal phase 3 studies:

- MONARCH 3 Study: Demonstrated a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 28.18 months with VERZENIOS in combination with an aromatase inhibitor, versus 14.76 months with placebo.

- MONARCH 2 Study: Showed a notable extension in PFS when VERZENIOS was used with fulvestrant—16.4 months versus 9.3 months in the placebo group.

- monarchE Study: In early breast cancer patients, the combination of VERZENIOS and endocrine therapy significantly reduced the risk of disease recurrence, showing an invasive disease-free survival rate of 92.6% at 24 months.

These results confirm VERZENIOS as a powerful option for patients seeking long-term disease control in both early-stage and metastatic breast cancer.



 Dosage and Administration

The recommended dosage of VERZENIOS is 150 mg twice daily. Tablets should be swallowed whole and not chewed, crushed, or split. In case of a missed dose or vomiting, patients should take the next scheduled dose without compensation.

Dose modifications may be necessary in the event of adverse reactions, such as:

- Neutropenia
- Diarrhea
- Liver enzyme elevations
- Interstitial lung disease
- Venous thromboembolic events

Close monitoring of complete blood counts and liver function is recommended during the first two months of therapy, and regularly thereafter.



 Safety Profile

The most common side effects reported with VERZENIOS include:

- Diarrhea (up to 85% incidence)
- Neutropenia
- Fatigue
- Nausea and vomiting
- Infections

Less frequent but serious risks include venous thromboembolism, interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis, and elevated liver enzymes. Patients should be advised to report any unusual symptoms promptly. Dose interruptions and reductions help manage many of these adverse effects effectively.
