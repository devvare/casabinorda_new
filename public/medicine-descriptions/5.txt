 VERZENIOS 100 mg 42 Film-Coated Tablets â€“ Product Information for Buyers and Distributors

VERZENIOS (abemaciclib) 100 mg film-coated tablets are a targeted oral therapy developed for the treatment of specific types of breast cancer. Manufactured by Eli Lilly, this medication has proven clinical efficacy in hormone receptor-positive (HR+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) breast cancer cases.

Each tablet contains 100 mg of abemaciclib, a potent and selective cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4 and 6 inhibitor. It functions by blocking the phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein, thereby halting tumor cell proliferation. This mechanism makes VERZENIOS a valuable component in pharmaceutical oncology care.



 Therapeutic Indications

VERZENIOS 100 mg is approved for use in combination with endocrine therapy for:

- Early Breast Cancer: In adults with HR+, HER2-negative, node-positive early breast cancer who are at a high risk of recurrence.
- Advanced/Metastatic Breast Cancer: In women with locally advanced or metastatic HR+/HER2- breast cancer. It is used either:
  - With an aromatase inhibitor or fulvestrant for initial endocrine-based therapy
  - Or after prior endocrine treatment has failed

In pre- or perimenopausal women, VERZENIOS is combined with a luteinising hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist.



 Dosage and Administration

The recommended dose for adults is 150 mg twice daily in combination with endocrine therapy. For specific patients or in response to side effects, dose reductions to 100 mg or 50 mg may be implemented. In certain drug interaction scenarios (e.g., CYP3A4 inhibitors), dose adjustments are necessary.

- Tablets should be swallowed whole and can be taken with or without food
- Patients should avoid grapefruit and grapefruit juice due to interaction risks

Treatment should continue until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs. For early breast cancer, therapy is recommended for a total of two years, unless disease recurs sooner.



 Safety Profile and Side Effects

VERZENIOS has been evaluated in large Phase 3 studies including MONARCH 2, MONARCH 3, and monarchE, confirming its safety and efficacy.

Most common side effects include:

- Diarrhea
- Neutropenia
- Fatigue
- Nausea
- Vomiting
- Alopecia
- Increased liver enzymes (ALT/AST)

Patients should be closely monitored for blood cell counts, liver function, and signs of infection or thrombosis during treatment. Dose modifications may be required depending on the severity and persistence of side effects.



 Packaging and Storage

VERZENIOS 100 mg film-coated tablets are available in packs of 42 tablets, designed to support structured daily dosing. Each tablet is white, oval, debossed with "Lilly" on one side and "100" on the other.

- Shelf Life: 3 years
- Storage Conditions: No special storage conditions required; store out of reach of children

The packaging is also compliant with regional labeling regulations, including a 2D barcode and Braille information, ensuring safe handling and traceability throughout the supply chain.



 Clinical Efficacy

VERZENIOS has demonstrated strong efficacy in extending progression-free survival (PFS) and improving invasive disease-free survival (IDFS) when used alongside standard endocrine therapies.

- In the MONARCH 3 trial, combining VERZENIOS with aromatase inhibitors resulted in a 46% reduction in disease progression or death.
- In the monarchE study, adjuvant use led to significantly improved outcomes in patients with high-risk early breast cancer.

These results support its growing use in both adjuvant and metastatic settings, making it a high-demand pharmaceutical product globally.
