 MUCOLATOR 200 MG/100 ML – PRODUCT INFORMATION

 1. Product Description

MUCOLATOR® 200 mg/5 ml Powder for Pediatric Syrup is a mucolytic formulation used in respiratory conditions characterized by thick, viscous secretions. Each 5 ml of reconstituted syrup contains 200 mg of acetylcysteine, a synthetic derivative of the amino acid cysteine. The active substance works by breaking disulfide bonds in mucus, making it less sticky and easier to expel from the respiratory tract.

The formulation is provided as a pale yellow powder, which must be reconstituted with water before use. Each pack contains 40 grams of powder in a 100 mL amber glass bottle, along with a dosing spoon marked at 2.5 mL and 5 mL intervals.

 2. Composition

Each 5 mL of the prepared syrup contains:
- Acetylcysteine – 200 mg

Other ingredients include:
- Sucrose
- Sorbitol (E420)
- Citric acid anhydrous
- Methylparahydroxybenzoate sodium (E219)
- Propylparahydroxybenzoate sodium (E217)
- Beta-carotene (E160)
- Flavoring agents (orange)
- Water (added during reconstitution)

 3. Therapeutic Indications

MUCOLATOR is indicated for:

- Relief of productive cough associated with excessive or thick mucus in conditions such as:
  - Bronchitis
  - Bronchiectasis

Its dual role as both a mucolytic and antidote enhances its utility in both respiratory and emergency settings.

- History of bronchospasm, unless closely monitored

It should also be avoided in infants under 1 year except under strict medical supervision and only if life-saving.

 6. Warnings and Precautions

- Bronchial secretion increase may occur. Ensure airway patency in patients with a weak cough reflex.
- Severe skin reactions (e.g., Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, Lyell’s Syndrome) have been reported. Discontinue use if rashes or mucosal lesions appear.
- Avoid inhalation of powder during preparation, particularly in patients with asthma or allergies.
- Exercise caution in patients with chronic liver or renal impairment, as drug clearance may be reduced.
- Contains sucrose and sorbitol – not suitable for patients with hereditary fructose intolerance or glucose-galactose malabsorption.

 7. Drug Interactions

- Antitussives (cough suppressants): May reduce cough reflex and impair mucus clearance. Avoid simultaneous use.
- Antibiotics: Interactions may occur with aminoglycosides, penicillins, tetracyclines, and cephalosporins. A minimum 2-hour interval is recommended.
- Nitroglycerin: Potentiation of vasodilatory and antiplatelet effects possible.
- Activated charcoal: May interfere with absorption; avoid co-administration.
- Carbamazepine: Possible reduction in serum levels, increasing seizure risk.

 8. Use in Specific Populations

 Pregnancy:
- Category B. No known teratogenic effects in animals. However, use during human pregnancy requires a risk-benefit evaluation.
  
 Lactation:
- Unknown if acetylcysteine passes into breast milk. Use only if the benefit outweighs the potential risk to the infant.

 Pediatric Use:
- Safe in children over 2 years.
- Under 2 years, only use under strict medical supervision.

 Geriatrics:
- No dedicated studies. Use cautiously due to reduced organ function.
