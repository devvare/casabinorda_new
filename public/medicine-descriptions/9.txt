 ARVILA-250 MG TABLETS Product Information

ARVILA® 250 mg tablets are a clinically approved treatment for advanced prostate cancer in adult men. Each film-coated tablet contains 250 mg of abiraterone acetate, an androgen biosynthesis inhibitor that plays a crucial role in the management of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).

Manufactured by Synthon Hispania S.L. in Spain and distributed by EİP Eczacıbaşı İlaç Pazarlama A.Ş. in Turkey, ARVILA is formulated under strict pharmaceutical quality standards to ensure patient safety, efficacy, and compliance with global regulations.



 Pharmaceutical Form and Composition

ARVILA is supplied as white to off-white, oval, film-coated tablets debossed with “ATN” on one side and “250” on the other. Each tablet is designed for oral administration and includes the following ingredients:

- Active ingredient: Abiraterone acetate (250 mg)
- Excipients: Lactose monohydrate, microcrystalline cellulose, povidone, croscarmellose sodium, colloidal anhydrous silica, magnesium stearate, and sodium lauryl sulfate

Each bottle contains 120 tablets, offering a full month’s treatment supply, ideal for hospitals and pharmaceutical wholesale channels.



 Mechanism of Action

Abiraterone acetate selectively inhibits CYP17, a critical enzyme involved in androgen synthesis. By blocking this enzyme, ARVILA reduces testosterone levels in the body—thereby inhibiting the growth and spread of androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cells.

This unique mechanism makes ARVILA a valuable option for patients who are not candidates for chemotherapy or have already received chemotherapy and experienced disease progression.



 Indications

ARVILA is indicated for the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer in adult males. It is specifically used in:

- Patients who have not previously undergone chemotherapy
- Individuals for whom chemotherapy is not suitable
- Patients who have had chemotherapy but whose disease has returned

To mitigate side effects such as fluid retention, high blood pressure, and hypokalemia, ARVILA must be administered in combination with prednisolone.



 Dosage and Administration

The recommended daily dose is 1,000 mg (four 250 mg tablets) taken orally once daily. Important usage guidelines include:

- Tablets must be taken on an empty stomach—at least one hour before or two hours after meals
- Swallow whole with water; do not chew, crush, or split the tablets
- Always co-administer with prednisolone as prescribed by the physician
- Continue prednisolone daily for the duration of abiraterone therapy



 Clinical Safety and Monitoring

Before initiating therapy with ARVILA, healthcare providers will assess liver function, cardiovascular health, and electrolyte levels. Periodic monitoring is essential to detect potential complications such as:

- Elevated liver enzymes
- Fluid accumulation or edema
- Low potassium levels
- High blood pressure

Patients with severe hepatic impairment should not use ARVILA. In cases of mild or moderate liver dysfunction, dosage adjustment or discontinuation may be necessary, depending on clinical assessment.



 Side Effects

As with all medications, ARVILA may cause side effects, though not everyone will experience them. Common adverse effects include:

- Very common: Swelling of legs or feet, high blood pressure, low potassium, urinary tract infection, diarrhea
- Common: Increased liver enzymes, irregular heartbeat, chest pain, high cholesterol, indigestion, rash
- Uncommon to rare: Heart failure, adrenal gland issues, acute liver failure, lung irritation (allergic alveolitis)

Patients are advised to contact their doctor immediately if they experience symptoms such as muscle weakness, palpitations, or jaundice, which may indicate serious complications.



 Precautions and Contraindications

Do not use ARVILA if:
- You are allergic to abiraterone or any component of the tablet
- You are female, especially if pregnant or breastfeeding
- You have severe liver damage
- You are receiving Ra-223 therapy (radioactive treatment for prostate cancer)

Men engaging in sexual activity with women of childbearing potential should use condoms and an additional contraceptive method during and for at least three weeks after treatment to prevent fetal exposure.



 Storage Conditions
