 6. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES  

 6.1 Pharmacodynamic Properties  
- Alfacalcidol is a vitamin D analog that requires only hepatic hydroxylation to form calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D₃), the active form.  
- It promotes calcium and phosphate absorption in the intestine, regulates bone mineralization, and controls parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels.

 6.2 Pharmacokinetic Properties  
- Rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.  
- Converted in the liver to active form calcitriol.  
- Excretion primarily via the bile and feces; minor renal excretion.
