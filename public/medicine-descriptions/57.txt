 1. Product Description

PREPAGEL® is a topical anti-inflammatory and analgesic gel used to relieve pain, swelling, and inflammation due to various musculoskeletal and vascular conditions. Each gram of gel contains:
- 0.01 g aescin, a natural anti-edematous and anti-inflammatory agent
- 0.05 g diethylamine salicylate, a salicylate derivative with analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties

Additional excipients include lavender oil, neroli oil, isopropanol, carbomer, and polyethylene glycol derivatives that provide skin-penetration enhancement and a soothing topical texture. PREPAGEL is available in 40 g aluminum tubes designed for external application only.

This topical product is distributed through licensed pharmaceutical suppliers and wholesale channels, making it available in pharmacies and hospitals. In countries with limited manufacturing access, PREPAGEL may be included in authorized import and export arrangements. Hospitals and healthcare facilities may purchase PREPAGEL in bulk for outpatient clinics and emergency care departments. It is not advised to buy the product for unsupervised home use without professional consultation.



 2. Therapeutic Indications

PREPAGEL is indicated for external use in the symptomatic treatment of:
- Bruises and contusions
- Sprains and strains (distortions)
- Localized swelling and hematomas
- Tendon sheath inflammations (tendovaginitis)
- Pain in the spinal area, including:
  - Cervical syndrome
  - Back pain
  - Lumbago
  - Sciatica
- Superficial thrombophlebitis

The combination of aescin and diethylamine salicylate provides both anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects, supporting faster recovery and improved patient comfort.



 3. Dosage and Administration

 Recommended Dosage:
Unless otherwise directed by a physician, apply once or multiple times daily depending on symptom severity.

 Method of Application:
- Squeeze a small amount (typically a few centimeters of gel) onto the affected skin area.
- Apply as a thin layer and gently massage into the skin until absorbed.
- Hands should be washed thoroughly after application unless treating the hands themselves.

 Duration of Treatment:
- Use continues until symptoms resolve.
- Prolonged use on large areas should be avoided without medical supervision.



 4. Contraindications

Do not use PREPAGEL in the following conditions:
- On open wounds, damaged skin, or irradiated areas
- In case of known hypersensitivity to any component, especially aescin or salicylate derivatives
- In children or individuals with salicylate sensitivity



 5. Warnings and Precautions

- Systemic Absorption: Extensive use on large areas may lead to systemic absorption of active substances. This may increase the effects of anticoagulants and certain medications like methotrexate or sulfonylureas.
- Use in children: Due to the risk of salicylate toxicity through dermal absorption, PREPAGEL should be used cautiously in children and only on small areas.
- Renal impairment: Patients with kidney dysfunction should avoid long-term application over large surfaces.
- Pregnancy and lactation: Should be used only if the benefit outweighs potential risks. Avoid use over large body surfaces and never apply to the breast area during breastfeeding.
- Eye and mucosal contact: Avoid contact with eyes, mucous membranes, or ingestion.

If any signs of allergic reactions (such as rash, burning, or itching) develop, discontinue use and consult a physician.



 6. Interactions with Other Medicinal Products

When applied over extensive areas, the active substances can interact with systemic medications, such as:
- Anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin): Potential enhancement of blood-thinning effects due to aescin
- Oral hypoglycemics (e.g., sulfonylureas): Enhanced glucose-lowering effect
- Methotrexate: Increased toxicity due to salicylate interference

Patients should inform their physician of all current medications to avoid interactions.



 7. Use in Specific Populations

 Pregnancy  
- Controlled human studies are not available. Use is only recommended if clearly needed, and only for short-term and limited-area application.

 Lactation  
- Avoid application on or near the breast area. Use only under medical guidance.

 Pediatric Use  
- Not recommended for widespread use in children. The thinner skin may absorb higher quantities, increasing risk of systemic toxicity.

 Geriatric Use  
- No specific contraindications. Standard precautions apply.



 8. Adverse Reactions

PREPAGEL is generally well tolerated. However, in rare cases, the following may occur:
- Skin irritation: Redness, itching, or mild burning
- Contact dermatitis
- Allergic reactions: Especially in sensitive individuals due to lavender or neroli oil
- Photosensitivity: Rare with topical salicylates

In the event of unexpected effects, discontinue use and consult a healthcare provider.



 9. Overdose

 Symptoms  
- Widespread application or accidental ingestion may cause systemic effects such as:
  - Salicylate toxicity (nausea, tinnitus, dizziness)
  - Bleeding tendencies
  - Hypoglycemia in diabetics on sulfonylureas

 Management  
- Wash off the gel with water and soap
- Symptomatic treatment
- Seek medical attention in the case of suspected overdose



 10. Storage and Shelf Life
