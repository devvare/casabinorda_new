 CLONITAB 10 mg/5 mL Vial – Comprehensive Pharmaceutical Overview

CLONITAB® is a potent intravenous antiplatelet agent containing abciximab, the Fab fragment of the chimeric monoclonal antibody 7E3. Supplied as a 10 mg/5 mL vial (2 mg/mL), it is formulated for use in hospitals and advanced clinical settings as an adjunct to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

Manufactured under strict pharmaceutical standards in South Korea, CLONITAB is intended for controlled intravenous administration by trained professionals. This product is available for global import and export, subject to regulatory approvals, and is increasingly recognized for its clinical efficacy and reliable safety profile.



 Key Pharmaceutical Characteristics

CLONITAB functions by binding to the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GP IIb/IIIa) receptor on activated platelets, blocking fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor binding, thereby inhibiting platelet aggregation. It also interacts with the vitronectin receptor (αvβ3), which plays a role in coagulation and cellular proliferation. This dual mechanism contributes to its robust antithrombotic properties.

Each vial of CLONITAB is a clear, sterile, preservative-free solution with pH 7.2, containing:

- 10 mg of abciximab (2 mg/mL)
- Sodium phosphate buffer
- Sodium chloride
- Polysorbate 80
- Water for Injection



 Clinical Use and Indications

CLONITAB (abciximab) is indicated as an adjunct in the prevention of ischemic cardiac complications during PCI procedures, including:

- Patients undergoing angioplasty or stent placement
- Those with unstable angina who are scheduled for PCI within 24 hours

It is not indicated for patients who are not undergoing PCI and should always be used in combination with aspirin and heparin for optimal therapeutic outcomes.



 Dosage and Administration

The recommended dose is a 0.25 mg/kg intravenous bolus, administered 10–60 minutes before PCI, followed by a continuous infusion of 0.125 µg/kg/min (up to 10 µg/min) for 12 hours. In unstable angina cases, the infusion may extend up to 24 hours, terminating one hour post-PCI.

Preparation and administration require sterile techniques, appropriate filters (0.2–0.22 µm), and separate IV lines. Visual inspection for particulate matter is crucial before infusion.



 Pharmacokinetics and Dynamics

- Rapid receptor binding: Plasma abciximab levels decline swiftly post-bolus with a half-life under 10 minutes.
- Receptor blockade duration: Over 80% of GP IIb/IIIa receptors are blocked during infusion, with platelet function recovering within 48 hours post-treatment.
- Extended platelet-bound presence: Abciximab can remain platelet-bound in circulation for over 15 days, even after plasma clearance.



 Safety Considerations

CLONITAB administration is associated with an increased risk of bleeding, especially when combined with other antithrombotic agents. The most frequent adverse reactions include:

- Bleeding at arterial access sites
- Gastrointestinal and genitourinary bleeding
- Thrombocytopenia
- Minor reactions like headache, nausea, and hypotension

Monitoring platelet counts and coagulation parameters (e.g., APTT, ACT) before and during treatment is essential. In case of serious, uncontrolled bleeding, immediate discontinuation and platelet transfusion may be required.



 Contraindications

CLONITAB should not be administered in the following situations:

- Active internal bleeding or recent major surgery/trauma
- History of stroke or significant cerebrovascular disease
- Severe, uncontrolled hypertension
- Thrombocytopenia (<100,000/µL)
- Known hypersensitivity to murine proteins or any component of the product



 Storage and Packaging

CLONITAB is packaged in single-use 5 mL vials, each containing 10 mg of abciximab. Storage conditions include:

- Refrigeration between 2°C and 8°C
- Protection from freezing and shaking
- Use before the expiration date
- Discard unused portions post-infusion

These stringent storage guidelines ensure the product’s stability and efficacy across all points of the pharmaceutical supply chain.



 Wholesale and Global Access

As a specialty biologic, CLONITAB is available for wholesale distribution through licensed pharmaceutical channels. Distributors looking to buy or import this product should ensure compliance with local regulatory frameworks regarding biologic medications and antiplatelet therapies.

The product’s manufacturer, ISU Abxis Co., Ltd., ensures high-quality production under GMP conditions, while Korea Vaccine Co., Ltd. handles final product manufacturing. These partners support export to regulated markets globally, including countries in Asia, Europe, and the Middle East.
