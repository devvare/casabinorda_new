 MUCOPLUS 1200 MG EFFERVESCENT TABLETS – PRODUCT INFORMATION

 1. Product Description

MUCOPLUS® 1200 mg is presented as effervescent tablets intended for oral use. Each tablet contains 1200 mg of acetylcysteine, a synthetic derivative of the amino acid cysteine with mucolytic properties. These tablets dissolve completely in water and are administered as a drinkable solution.

The product is supplied in a plastic tube containing 20 tablets, each sealed with a moisture-absorbing cap. The tablets are white, round, and flat in appearance, and have a pleasant lemon flavor when dissolved.

 2. Composition

 Active Substance:
- Acetylcysteine – 1200 mg per tablet

 Excipients:
- Monosodium citrate

- The treatment of respiratory tract diseases associated with excessive, thick, and tenacious mucus.
