 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES  

 5.1 Pharmacodynamic Properties  
- Bisphosphonate that preferentially localizes to bone resorption surfaces and inhibits osteoclast activity, reducing bone turnover and increasing bone mineral density.  

 5.2 Pharmacokinetic Properties  
- Oral bioavailability ~0.6% fasting; decreased by 60% if taken with coffee or orange juice; negligible with food; protein binding ~78%; terminal half‑life > 10 years due to bone retention; ~50% excreted unchanged in urine within 72 hours.

 5.3 Preclinical Safety Data  
- Animal studies show reproductive toxicity (dystocia, fetal ossification defects) at high doses; no genotoxicity; rodent carcinogenicity findings (Harderian gland, thyroid adenomas) of unknown human relevance.
