 GLUCOBAY 50 MG 90 TAB – PRODUCT INFORMATION

 Product Description

GLUCOBAY® 50 mg tablet is an oral anti-diabetic medication containing acarbose as its active substance. Each tablet includes 50 mg of acarbose, an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor derived from microbial sources. The tablets are white to off-white in color, round in shape, marked with “G 50” on one side and the Bayer logo on the other.

Manufactured by Bayer Türk Kimya Sanayi Ltd. Şti. under license from Bayer Schering Pharma AG, Germany, GLUCOBAY® is classified under the pharmaceutical group for managing blood glucose levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

 Therapeutic Indications

GLUCOBAY® is indicated for:
- The treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, when diet alone does not provide adequate glycemic control.
- The prevention of type 2 diabetes in individuals diagnosed with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT).

By slowing the digestion of carbohydrates in the small intestine, GLUCOBAY® helps manage postprandial blood glucose levels, reducing glucose spikes after meals. This aids in overall glycemic control and contributes to the prevention of cardiovascular events related to diabetes.

 Dosage and Administration

Treatment should always begin under the supervision of a physician, and dosing should be individually adjusted.

 Recommended Doses:
- Initial therapy: One tablet (50 mg) three times daily.
- If tolerated, dosage may be gradually increased to two tablets (100 mg) three times daily, equivalent to 300 mg/day.

In patients with IGT, the dose begins at 50 mg per day and is increased over three months to 100 mg three times a day.

 Administration Method:
Tablets must be chewed with the first bites of a meal or swallowed with a little liquid just before eating. The medication has no duration limitation when used appropriately.

 Special Populations

- Elderly (65+ years): No dosage adjustment is required.
- Children under 18: The efficacy and safety of GLUCOBAY® have not been established in this age group.
- Patients with severe renal impairment: Use is contraindicated.

 Contraindications

GLUCOBAY® should not be used in individuals with:
- Hypersensitivity to acarbose or any other component of the formulation.
- Chronic digestive or absorption disorders.
- Liver cirrhosis.
- Severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance <25 ml/min).
- Intestinal disorders that cause gas accumulation, such as intestinal obstructions or ulcers.

 Warnings and Precautions

Liver enzyme levels may increase asymptomatically in some patients, particularly at higher doses. Monitoring liver function tests every 3–6 months during the first year is recommended. If abnormalities occur, treatment should be re-evaluated.

 Interactions with Other Drugs

GLUCOBAY® can interact with other medications. Notable interactions include:
- Increased gastrointestinal symptoms when used with neomycin.
- May reduce the bioavailability of digoxin.
- Avoid concurrent use with antacids, digestive enzyme preparations, and intestinal adsorbents, as they may decrease efficacy.
- When used in combination with sulfonylureas, metformin, or insulin, the risk of hypoglycemia increases. If symptoms occur, glucose (not sucrose) should be used for rapid correction.

 Side Effects

 Very Common (≥1/10):
- Flatulence

 Common (≥1/100 to <1/10):
- Diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, gastrointestinal pain

 Uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100):
- Nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia
- Elevated liver enzymes

 Rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000):
- Jaundice, edema

 Unknown Frequency:
- Thrombocytopenia
- Allergic reactions (rash, erythema, urticaria)
- Hepatitis
- Rare gastrointestinal complications (e.g., bowel obstruction, pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis)

Intestinal side effects are often diet-dependent and diminish over time or with strict adherence to the recommended dietary regimen.

 Overdose

Overdose symptoms include increased gas, abdominal bloating, and diarrhea, especially if combined with carbohydrate-rich meals. If overdose occurs:
- Avoid carbohydrate-containing food and drinks for 4–6 hours.
- Treatment is usually symptomatic, and no specific antidote is required.

 Pharmacological Properties

 Mechanism of Action:
Acarbose inhibits enzymes (alpha-glucosidases) in the small intestine that break down complex carbohydrates into glucose. This results in delayed carbohydrate digestion and a gradual rise in blood sugar, reducing the risk of postprandial hyperglycemia.

 Pharmacokinetics:
- Low systemic absorption (1–2%)
- Most of the drug acts locally in the intestine
- Elimination: ~35% via kidneys, ~51% via feces

This low absorption ensures minimal systemic side effects while maintaining local efficacy.

 Use in Pregnancy and Lactation

- GLUCOBAY® is classified as Pregnancy Category B.
- There is limited human data. Therefore, use in pregnancy is not recommended unless necessary.
- In lactation, trace amounts were found in animal studies, but human data is insufficient. It is generally not advised during breastfeeding.

 Packaging and Storage

GLUCOBAY® 50 mg tablets are available in blister packs of 30, 60, or 90 tablets. Store at temperatures below 30°C, in the original packaging. Once removed from the blister, the tablets should be used immediately to avoid degradation.

GLUCOBAY® can be distributed for wholesale within approved pharmacy networks. Import and export of the product must comply with local health authority regulations to ensure proper handling, quality control, and patient safety. Any purchase from unauthorized sources is strongly discouraged.
