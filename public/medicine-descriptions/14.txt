 GLUCOBAY 50 MG 30 TAB – PRODUCT INFORMATION

 General Overview

GLUCOBAY® 50 mg is an oral antidiabetic medication designed to manage blood glucose levels in patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus or those with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). Each tablet contains 50 mg of acarbose, a pseudotetrasaccharide derived from microbial sources, functioning as an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor.

Manufactured under the license of Bayer Schering Pharma AG (Germany), GLUCOBAY® is distributed by Bayer Türk Kimya Sanayi Ltd. Şti. It is available in packages of 30, 60, or 90 tablets. This pharmaceutical product is regulated for both import and export in accordance with international health standards and has been in clinical use since its initial registration on September 28, 1993.

 Description and Mechanism of Action

GLUCOBAY® tablets are round, pale yellow-white in color, with "G 50" marked on one side and the Bayer logo on the reverse. The active ingredient, acarbose, functions by inhibiting enzymes that break down complex carbohydrates in the small intestine. This inhibition slows glucose absorption into the bloodstream, reducing postprandial hyperglycemia and stabilizing blood sugar fluctuations throughout the day.

Acarbose is not significantly absorbed systemically, with only 1–2% bioavailability. Its action is localized in the intestine, and therapeutic efficacy is achieved through its enzyme-inhibiting properties rather than systemic effects.

 Indications

GLUCOBAY® 50 mg is indicated for:
- Adjunctive treatment of type 2 diabetes in patients who cannot achieve adequate glycemic control through diet alone
- Preventing the onset of type 2 diabetes in individuals with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT)

 Dosage and Administration

Dosage is individualized and should be adjusted based on clinical response and gastrointestinal tolerance:

- Initial dose: 1 tablet (50 mg) three times a day with meals
- Maintenance dose: May be increased to 2 tablets (100 mg) three times daily
- Maximum dose (in rare cases): Up to 3x200 mg daily may be required in resistant cases

For patients with IGT, the typical regimen starts at 50 mg per day and is gradually increased to 100 mg three times a day over three months.

Administration: Tablets should be taken just before meals or with the first few bites. They may be swallowed with a little liquid or chewed.

 Special Populations

- Elderly: No dosage adjustment is required.
- Pediatrics: Not recommended for individuals under 18 years old due to insufficient safety and efficacy data.
- Renal impairment: Contraindicated in patients with severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance <25 mL/min).

 Contraindications

Do not use GLUCOBAY® if you have:
- Hypersensitivity to acarbose or any of its components
- Chronic intestinal diseases with malabsorption or digestive disorders
- Liver cirrhosis
- Conditions involving excessive gas formation in the intestines
- Severe kidney failure

 Warnings and Precautions

Monitoring liver enzymes is recommended during the first 6 to 12 months of therapy, especially when higher doses are prescribed. In most cases, elevations are reversible upon discontinuation.

Patients must strictly follow dietary recommendations. Failure to comply can intensify gastrointestinal side effects such as bloating, gas, and diarrhea.

 Drug Interactions

Acarbose can enhance the effects of other antidiabetic agents such as:
- Sulfonylureas
- Metformin
- Insulin

In such combinations, the risk of hypoglycemia increases. In the event of low blood sugar, glucose (not sucrose) must be used for correction due to acarbose’s inhibition of disaccharide metabolism.

Other potential interactions include:
- Digoxin: Bioavailability may be affected
- Antacids, cholestyramine, digestive enzymes: May reduce acarbose effectiveness
- Neomycin: Can increase gastrointestinal side effects

 Side Effects

Very common:
- Flatulence

Common:
- Diarrhea
- Abdominal discomfort

Uncommon:
- Nausea
- Vomiting
- Dyspepsia
- Liver enzyme elevation

Rare:
- Jaundice
- Edema

Unknown frequency:
- Hepatitis
- Bowel obstruction
- Thrombocytopenia
- Allergic skin reactions (rash, erythema, urticaria)

Patients should report any unexpected effects to their healthcare provider. In case of serious adverse reactions, discontinuation and medical evaluation are advised.

 Overdose

When consumed with carbohydrate-rich foods or drinks, overdose may lead to:
- Severe bloating
- Flatulence
- Diarrhea

Patients should avoid carbohydrate intake for 4–6 hours following an overdose. If the overdose occurs independently of meals, significant symptoms are unlikely.

 Storage

Store below 30°C, in a dry place, in original packaging. Once removed from its blister pack, the tablet should be used immediately. Tablets exposed to heat or humidity may discolor and lose effectiveness.
