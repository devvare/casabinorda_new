 ASPIRIN 100 MG TABLET – PRODUCT INFORMATION

 1. Product Overview

ASPIRIN® 100 mg is a tablet formulation containing acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), a widely used compound with analgesic, antipyretic, anti-inflammatory, and antiplatelet properties. Each tablet contains 100 mg of acetylsalicylic acid, and the product is typically marketed in packs of 20 tablets for oral administration.

ASPIRIN belongs to the class of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and is used to reduce fever, relieve mild to moderate pain, and most notably, to prevent blood clot formation in cardiovascular conditions. It is produced under strict pharmaceutical standards to ensure quality and efficacy.

 2. Therapeutic Indications

ASPIRIN 100 mg is indicated for:

- Standard treatment in unstable angina pectoris
- Acute myocardial infarction (heart attack)
- Prevention of recurrent myocardial infarction
- Prevention of vascular occlusions and clot formation following heart surgery
- Prevention of transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) and strokes in high-risk patients
- In Kawasaki disease (a rare pediatric vascular condition), to manage inflammation and reduce the risk of coronary aneurysms and thrombosis

Its primary mechanism is inhibition of platelet aggregation, making it a cornerstone in cardiovascular prophylaxis.

 3. Dosage and Administration

ASPIRIN should always be taken as prescribed by a physician. The typical dosage for adults is as follows:

- Unstable angina or acute myocardial infarction: 75–300 mg once daily
- Post-cardiac surgery (PTCA, CABG): 75–300 mg once daily
- Prevention of stroke or TIA: 75–300 mg once daily
- Kawasaki disease:
  - In acute febrile phase: 30–50 mg/kg/day in divided doses
  - In subacute phase: 3–5 mg/kg/day

Tablets should be swallowed with a generous amount of water after meals to minimize gastrointestinal irritation. Avoid use on an empty stomach.

ASPIRIN is not recommended for routine use in children under 18 years due to the risk of Reye’s syndrome.

 4. Contraindications

ASPIRIN 100 mg is contraindicated in the following cases:

- Hypersensitivity to acetylsalicylic acid or NSAIDs
- History of aspirin-induced asthma, nasal polyps, or allergic reactions
- Active gastrointestinal ulcers or bleeding
- Severe liver, kidney, or heart failure
- Bleeding disorders (e.g., hemophilia)
- Concurrent high-dose methotrexate use (≥15 mg/week)
- Pregnancy during the third trimester
- Patients receiving heparin therapy

 5. Warnings and Precautions

Use ASPIRIN with caution in the following situations:

- History of asthma, allergic conditions, or nasal polyps
- Concurrent use of anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin)
- Impaired kidney or liver function
- Prior ulcers or gastrointestinal bleeding
- Gout or predisposition to hyperuricemia
- Scheduled surgery or dental procedures (due to bleeding risk)
- Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency
- Clotting disorders, vitamin K deficiency, or low prothrombin levels

Chronic use of pain relievers may lead to kidney damage, particularly with multi-drug regimens. Patients should avoid combining ASPIRIN with other NSAIDs unless directed by a healthcare provider.

 6. Use During Pregnancy and Lactation

 Pregnancy:
- Avoid use in the third trimester, as it may harm the fetus or delay labor.
- During the first two trimesters, use only if clearly necessary.

 Breastfeeding:
- Small amounts may pass into breast milk.
- Occasional use does not typically require discontinuation of breastfeeding, but regular or high doses should be avoided.

Consult a healthcare provider before using ASPIRIN during pregnancy or lactation.

 7. Interactions with Other Medications

ASPIRIN can interact with numerous medications, including:

- Anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin, heparin)
- NSAIDs and corticosteroids – increased GI bleeding risk
- SSRIs – additive bleeding risk
- Methotrexate – increased toxicity
- Diuretics and antihypertensives – reduced efficacy
- Sulfonylureas and insulin – may enhance hypoglycemic effects
- Probenecid and benzbromarone – reduced effectiveness in gout management
- Digoxin – increased plasma levels
- Antiepileptics (e.g., valproic acid)
- Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors – risk of metabolic acidosis
- Antacids, vitamin C, metoclopramide – can alter absorption

Always inform your healthcare provider about all medications you are using, including those obtained over the counter or through online buy platforms.

 8. Side Effects

 Common:
- Gastric discomfort, nausea, vomiting
- Heartburn and abdominal pain

 Rare:
- Gastrointestinal bleeding
- Ulcers that may lead to perforation
- Allergic reactions including rash, urticaria, or bronchospasm
- Anaphylactic shock in severe cases
- Liver enzyme elevation
- Kidney function impairment
- Tinnitus, headache, dizziness (signs of overdose)

 Very Rare:
- Hemolytic anemia in G6PD-deficient patients
- Reye’s syndrome in children with viral infections

Seek immediate medical attention if symptoms of allergic reactions or bleeding occur.

 9. Overdose

Symptoms of overdose may include:

- Tinnitus, confusion, hyperventilation
- Dehydration, fever, and electrolyte imbalance
