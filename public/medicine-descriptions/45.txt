 AKLOVIR (Acyclovir) 800 mg 20 Tablets – PRODUCT INFORMATION

 1. Product Description

AKLOVIR® 800 mg tablet is an oral antiviral medicine containing acyclovir, a synthetic purine nucleoside analogue with strong activity against Herpes simplex virus (HSV) types 1 and 2 and Varicella zoster virus (VZV). This formulation is particularly indicated in the treatment of chickenpox (varicella) and shingles (herpes zoster), as well as for managing herpes-related complications in immunocompromised individuals.

The product is supplied in blister packs of 20 tablets, with each tablet being white, oblong, and scored on both sides for dose flexibility. AKLOVIR is produced under high-quality pharmaceutical standards and distributed through licensed wholesale systems. In certain jurisdictions, the drug may be included in import or export lists for clinical distribution purposes.



 2. Composition

Active ingredient:
- Acyclovir 800 mg per tablet

Excipients:
- Lactose monohydrate
- Sodium starch glycolate
- Microcrystalline cellulose
- Magnesium stearate
- Copovidone

These excipients enhance the stability, compressibility, and bioavailability of the tablet.



 3. Indications

AKLOVIR 800 mg tablets are indicated for:
- Treatment of Varicella (chickenpox)
- Management of Herpes Zoster (shingles)
- Treatment of HSV and VZV infections in patients with advanced HIV or after bone marrow transplantation
- Preventing disease progression and reducing the incidence of post-herpetic neuralgia

Clinical studies demonstrate that early initiation of acyclovir therapy significantly improves outcomes in shingles by reducing both the intensity and duration of symptoms.



 4. Dosage and Administration

 Adults:
- Shingles and chickenpox: 800 mg (1 tablet) five times daily, at approximately 4-hour intervals, omitting the nighttime dose, for 7 days.
- Severe immunosuppression (e.g., post-transplant or HIV patients): 800 mg four times daily (every 6 hours).

In immunocompromised patients or those with gastrointestinal malabsorption, intravenous acyclovir may be preferred initially.

 Children:
- ≥6 years: 800 mg four times daily
- 2–6 years: 400 mg four times daily
- <2 years: 200 mg four times daily

Alternatively, dosing may be calculated as 20 mg/kg per dose, not to exceed 800 mg daily. Treatment should last for 5 days.

 Elderly Patients:
Older patients often exhibit decreased renal function. Hydration is essential, and dose adjustments may be necessary to reduce the risk of neurological side effects.

 Renal Impairment:
- Severe impairment (CrCl <10 mL/min): 800 mg every 12 hours
- Moderate impairment (CrCl 10–25 mL/min): 800 mg every 8 hours

Ensure adequate hydration during therapy to reduce the risk of crystalluria and nephrotoxicity.



 5. Contraindications

- Known hypersensitivity to acyclovir, valacyclovir, or any excipients
- Patients with rare hereditary disorders such as galactose intolerance, Lapp lactase deficiency, or glucose-galactose malabsorption



 6. Warnings and Precautions

- Patients should begin therapy as soon as possible, preferably at the first appearance of a rash.
- Neurological reactions such as hallucinations, agitation, and confusion may occur in those with renal impairment.
- Patients should be advised to avoid contact with others during active viral outbreaks to reduce the risk of transmission.
- Tablets contain lactose; not suitable for those with lactose intolerance.



 7. Drug Interactions

No clinically significant drug interactions have been confirmed, but:
- Probenecid and cimetidine may raise plasma levels of acyclovir
- Co-administration with mycophenolate mofetil in transplant patients can increase systemic exposure

Due to acyclovir’s wide therapeutic index, routine dose adjustments are not typically required.



 8. Use in Special Populations

 Pregnancy (Category B):
Available human data suggest no increased risk of fetal abnormalities. Animal studies confirm no teratogenicity. Use only when benefits outweigh potential risks.

 Lactation:
Acyclovir is excreted in breast milk. Infant exposure is low (approx. 0.3 mg/kg/day) and generally considered safe. Monitor infant if long-term use is required.

 Fertility:
No adverse effects on male fertility were observed in studies where men took 1 g/day of acyclovir for six months.



 9. Adverse Reactions

 Common (≥1/100 to <1/10):
- Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea
- Headache, dizziness
- Fatigue, fever
- Skin rashes, itching

 Uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100):
- Hair thinning
- Urticaria (hives)
- Mild elevation in liver enzymes

 Rare to Very Rare (<1/10,000):
- Anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia
- Neurological symptoms: tremor, confusion, hallucinations, encephalopathy
- Hepatitis, jaundice
- Acute renal failure, renal pain
- Hypersensitivity (including anaphylaxis, angioedema)

Most side effects are mild and reversible upon discontinuation.



 10. Overdose

High doses over several days may lead to:
- Gastrointestinal symptoms
- Neurological signs (e.g., confusion, hallucinations)

In case of overdose, initiate supportive treatment. Hemodialysis can effectively reduce acyclovir blood levels.



 11. Storage and Packaging

- Store at room temperature (below 25°C), in a dry place
- Protect from moisture and light
- Keep out of reach of children

Packaging:  
- 20 tablets in blister packs, enclosed in cartons

Facilities may purchase AKLOVIR via verified medical distributors. For those looking to buy internationally, licensed import and export routes must comply with national drug laws and product authenticity protocols.
