 AKLOVIR (Acyclovir) 200 mg/100 mL Suspension – PRODUCT INFORMATION

 1. Product Overview

AKLOVIR® 200 mg/5 mL oral suspension is a ready-to-use antiviral medication containing acyclovir, a synthetic purine nucleoside analogue. This medication is effective against Herpes simplex virus (HSV) types 1 and 2 and Varicella zoster virus (VZV). It is used for both the treatment and prevention of various herpes infections.

AKLOVIR suspension is particularly beneficial for pediatric patients and individuals who have difficulty swallowing tablets. The product is distributed in 100 mL polyethylene bottles, and may be available for purchase by hospitals, pharmacies, and clinics through licensed pharmaceutical and wholesale distributors. Some countries may require special permits for import or export due to the drug’s antiviral classification.

 7. Drug Interactions

No significant interactions are expected at normal doses. However:
- Probenecid and cimetidine may increase acyclovir plasma levels
- Concomitant use with mycophenolate mofetil may increase overall exposure

Routine dose adjustment is generally unnecessary, but co-administration should be reported to a healthcare provider.
