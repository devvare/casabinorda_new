 DIFFERIN 0.1% Gel (Adapalene) 30 g – PRODUCT INFORMATION

 1. Product Description

DIFFERIN® 0.1% Gel is a topical retinoid formulation containing adapalene (0.1 g per 100 g gel), indicated for the treatment of moderate acne vulgaris. It is presented as a white, homogenous gel for topical use only, supplied in 30-gram aluminum tubes. This product provides an effective therapy that addresses both inflammatory and non-inflammatory acne lesions.

The active ingredient adapalene is a retinoid-like compound that binds to specific retinoic acid nuclear receptors, helping to normalize skin cell differentiation and reduce inflammation.

DIFFERIN is manufactured under strict pharmaceutical quality standards and distributed to healthcare institutions and retail pharmacies through licensed wholesale networks. In various international markets, it may be accessed via import and export operations, subject to regulatory controls.



 2. Composition

Active substance:  
- Adapalene 0.1 g per 100 g

Excipients:  
- Propylene glycol  
- Methyl parahydroxybenzoate (E218)  
- Carbomer 980  
- Poloxamer 182  
- Sodium edetate  
- Phenoxyethanol  
- Sodium hydroxide  
- Purified water

These components provide the gel with its physical stability and ensure effective cutaneous application.



 3. Indications

DIFFERIN is indicated for the topical treatment of acne vulgaris, particularly in cases of comedonal and papulopustular acne. It is not indicated for nodulocystic acne or severe forms of the disease.

The product should be used in conjunction with non-comedogenic skin care routines and may be used alongside other acne therapies such as topical antibiotics or benzoyl peroxide, as clinically appropriate.



 4. Dosage and Administration

Apply once daily at night, before bedtime, after thoroughly cleansing and drying the skin. A pea-sized amount of gel should be gently spread over the entire affected area, avoiding the eyes, lips, and mucous membranes.

 Important Notes:
- Do not apply an excessive quantity of the gel; it does not enhance efficacy, but may increase the risk of irritation, redness, and peeling.
- If irritation occurs, application frequency may be reduced or temporarily suspended.
- For patients experiencing mild discomfort, supportive measures such as non-comedogenic moisturizers may be recommended.



 5. Pharmacological Properties

 Pharmacodynamic Properties  
Adapalene exhibits anti-comedogenic, keratolytic, and anti-inflammatory properties. It binds to specific retinoic acid nuclear receptors but does not interact with cytosolic receptor proteins. This binding normalizes the differentiation of follicular epithelial cells and prevents microcomedone formation.

In animal models, adapalene reduces epidermal hyperkeratinization and decreases inflammatory responses by inhibiting arachidonic acid metabolism.

 Pharmacokinetics
- Absorption: Low percutaneous absorption (~4% of applied dose)
- Distribution: Not specifically documented
- Metabolism: Primarily via hydroxylation, O-demethylation, and conjugation
- Excretion: Primarily through the biliary route

Due to its minimal systemic absorption, adapalene is unlikely to produce systemic effects or interact significantly with other systemically administered drugs.



 6. Warnings and Precautions

- Avoid contact with eyes, lips, nose, and damaged skin.
- In case of accidental contact, rinse thoroughly with warm water.
- Avoid excessive sun exposure and UV lamps during treatment. If unavoidable, use protective clothing and sunscreen.
- Do not use with other irritating agents such as alcohol-based solutions, astringents, or abrasive cleansers.
- If the patient has eczema or sunburn, treatment should be postponed until healing occurs.

In case of hypersensitivity reactions or severe irritation, treatment should be discontinued.



 7. Drug Interactions

Topical adapalene may be used alongside benzoyl peroxide, clindamycin, or erythromycin, provided they are applied at different times of the day (e.g., adapalene at night, others in the morning). No significant chemical degradation occurs when used concurrently.

No systemic drug interactions are expected due to the limited dermal absorption of adapalene.



 8. Use in Specific Populations

 Pregnancy  
Category C. While oral retinoids are known teratogens, the systemic absorption of topical adapalene is minimal. Nevertheless, its use during pregnancy is not recommended, especially during the first trimester. If pregnancy occurs during use, discontinue immediately.

 Lactation  
Topical adapalene may be used with caution during breastfeeding, but it should not be applied to the chest area to prevent unintentional contact with the nursing infant.

 Pediatrics and Geriatrics  
- Not recommended in children under 12 due to lack of safety data.
- No dosage adjustment is necessary for elderly patients, although clinical experience is limited.



 9. Adverse Reactions

 Common (≥1/100 to <1/10):
- Skin dryness  
- Irritation  
- Erythema  
- Burning sensation

 Uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100):
- Contact dermatitis  
- Skin discomfort  
- Peeling  
- Sunburn  
- Itching

 Unknown frequency:
- Eyelid swelling  
- Pain at the application site  
- Allergic reaction (due to methyl parahydroxybenzoate or propylene glycol)

Most reactions are local and mild to moderate in severity, typically resolving with continued or adjusted use.



 10. Overdose

Topical overdose is unlikely. Excessive use may lead to increased local irritation but will not enhance therapeutic effect. If accidentally ingested, consult a medical professional; consider gastric lavage in rare cases of high oral exposure.



 11. Storage and Handling

- Store below 25°C.  
- Do not refrigerate or freeze.  
- Keep tube tightly closed when not in use.  
- Keep out of reach of children.  
- Do not use after the expiry date on the label.

Unused product should be disposed of in accordance with local regulations for pharmaceutical waste.
