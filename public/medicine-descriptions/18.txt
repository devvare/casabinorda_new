RANTUDIL RETARD is prescribed for the management of:

- Rheumatoid arthritis
- Psoriatic arthritis
- Acute irritation due to degenerative joint diseases (arthrosis, spondylarthrosis)

- Acute gout attacks
- Tendonitis, tenosynovitis, bursitis

 Dosage and Administration

Dosage should always be tailored by a healthcare professional.

- Acute Gout Attack: Up to 2 capsules daily until symptoms subside. Do not exceed 180 mg/day for more than 7 days.

 Use in Specific Populations

- Children and Adolescents: Not recommended for patients under 18 years.
- Elderly: Use cautiously, particularly due to the increased risk of gastrointestinal and cardiovascular side effects.

 Warnings and Precautions

 Gastrointestinal Risk

Serious GI events like ulcers, bleeding, and perforation may occur without warning, especially in elderly patients. Risk increases with prolonged use or high doses.

 Cardiovascular and Renal Effects

NSAIDs may raise the risk of thrombotic events such as myocardial infarction or stroke. Use caution in patients with cardiovascular disease, hypertension, or fluid retention. Renal function can be compromised, particularly in those with preexisting conditions.

 Hepatic Considerations

Regular liver function monitoring is recommended during long-term therapy, as liver enzyme levels may become elevated.

 Dermatologic Reactions

Severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), have been reported. Discontinue treatment at the first sign of rash.

 Drug Interactions

RANTUDIL RETARD may interact with the following medications:

- Other NSAIDs or Aspirin – increased risk of GI bleeding
- Anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin) – increased bleeding tendency
- Diuretics and ACE inhibitors – reduced renal function
- SSRIs, corticosteroids – increased GI side effects
- Lithium, digoxin, methotrexate – elevated serum levels and toxicity
- Sulfonylureas – potential effect on blood glucose
- Penicillin antibiotics – delayed clearance

Always inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, or herbal products you are taking.

 Pregnancy and Lactation

- Pregnancy: Contraindicated during the third trimester. Use in earlier stages only if absolutely necessary and under physician supervision.
- Lactation: Trace amounts of the drug may pass into breast milk. Its use during breastfeeding is not recommended.

Women planning pregnancy or facing fertility issues should avoid prolonged use, as NSAIDs may impair fertility.
