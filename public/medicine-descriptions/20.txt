 DIAZOMID 250 MG TABLET – PRODUCT INFORMATION

 1. Product Description

DIAZOMID® 250 mg tablet is an oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitor containing acetazolamide as the active pharmaceutical ingredient. Each tablet contains 250 mg of acetazolamide, and the product is supplied in blister packs containing 10 tablets.

This medication is classified under diuretics and antiepileptic agents and is commonly used for managing elevated intraocular pressure, reducing fluid retention, and controlling certain types of seizures. Its usage in both ophthalmic and systemic indications makes it a versatile therapeutic option in clinical settings.

 2. Therapeutic Indications

DIAZOMID is prescribed by physicians for the following conditions:

- Glaucoma: to reduce intraocular pressure in both open-angle and secondary forms
- Edema: to manage fluid retention associated with cardiac or drug-induced causes
- Epilepsy: as an adjunctive therapy in certain types of seizures, including absence seizures

Its diuretic and pressure-lowering effects are the result of acetazolamide’s ability to inhibit the enzyme carbonic anhydrase, thereby reducing the production of aqueous humor and promoting urinary excretion of bicarbonate.

 3. Dosage and Administration

Dosage varies depending on the indication and individual patient response.

 In Adults:
- Glaucoma: 250–1000 mg per day in divided doses
- Edema: Initial dose is 250–375 mg once daily in the morning
- Epilepsy: 250–1000 mg per day, divided into multiple doses

 In Children:
- For epilepsy: Doses depend on body weight and are administered in divided doses. The maximum daily dose should not exceed 750 mg.

DIAZOMID should be swallowed whole with water, either shortly before or after meals. Tablets should not be crushed or chewed.

 4. Contraindications

Do not use DIAZOMID in the following cases:

- Allergy to acetazolamide or any component of the product
- Significant hepatic or renal impairment
- Adrenal insufficiency (Addison’s disease)
- Marked electrolyte imbalance (e.g., hyponatremia, hypokalemia)
- Hyperchloremic acidosis
- Closed-angle glaucoma

 5. Warnings and Precautions

 Mental Health Risk:
In rare cases, patients treated with acetazolamide have reported suicidal ideation. Patients should immediately report any mood changes, depression, or unusual behavior to their healthcare provider.

 Renal and Hepatic Monitoring:
Patients with a history of kidney stones, chronic liver disease, or any known renal condition must be carefully monitored during treatment. Liver enzymes and kidney function should be checked periodically.

 Use in the Elderly:
In patients over 65, the risk of adverse effects is increased. Renal, hepatic, and cardiac functions must be evaluated prior to and during treatment.

 Special Dietary Instructions:
DIAZOMID contains lactose and tartrazine, which may cause allergic reactions in susceptible individuals. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance should consult their doctor before use.

 Drug Interactions:
DIAZOMID may interact with:

- Antihypertensives and diuretics: increased risk of electrolyte imbalance
- Antiepileptic agents (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, topiramate): potential additive CNS effects
- Anticoagulants: enhanced effects of warfarin
- Oral antidiabetics: altered glucose regulation
- Salicylates: increased risk of metabolic acidosis
- Corticosteroids: may reduce potassium levels
- Lithium: reduced serum lithium levels
- Methotrexate and trimethoprim: potential for folate deficiency

 6. Pregnancy and Lactation

 Pregnancy:
DIAZOMID is not recommended during the first trimester of pregnancy due to potential teratogenic risks. Use only when absolutely necessary and under medical supervision.

 Lactation:
