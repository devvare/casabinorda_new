 CAMPRAL-333 MG 84 TABLETS Product Information

CAMPRAL® 333 mg gastro-resistant tablets are an effective and clinically proven oral treatment for supporting alcohol abstinence in adults with alcohol dependence. Each tablet contains 333 mg of acamprosate calcium, a substance that modulates the balance of neurotransmitters disrupted by chronic alcohol use. 

Manufactured by Merck Santé s.a.s. in France and marketed in the UK by Merck Serono Limited, CAMPRAL tablets are widely used in pharmaceutical treatment programs in Europe and around the world. The product is available in blister packs, commonly dispensed in boxes of 84 tablets, suitable for short-term and monthly use under professional supervision.



 Indications and Therapeutic Use

CAMPRAL is indicated for the maintenance of abstinence in alcohol-dependent patients. It is particularly effective when used in conjunction with psychological counseling or therapy. While it does not alleviate the physical symptoms of alcohol withdrawal, CAMPRAL helps restore the chemical balance in the brain altered by long-term alcohol abuse.

Patients beginning CAMPRAL treatment should already have completed initial withdrawal and detoxification, as the medication is most effective when alcohol use has been stopped. Continued alcohol consumption during treatment reduces its effectiveness and increases the risk of relapse.



 Mechanism of Action

The active substance, acamprosate calcium, acts on the central nervous system by stabilizing chemical activity in the brain. Chronic alcohol use disturbs the balance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters, particularly glutamate and GABA. CAMPRAL helps normalize this imbalance, reducing cravings and the psychological stress associated with alcohol abstinence.

Unlike disulfiram or naltrexone, CAMPRAL does not cause aversion to alcohol and does not block alcohol's effects—instead, it reduces the brain's desire for alcohol over time, helping to prevent relapse.



 Dosage and Administration

Dosage is based on body weight:

- For adults weighing 60 kg or more, the recommended dose is 6 tablets per day: 2 in the morning, 2 at midday, and 2 in the evening.
- For adults under 60 kg, the dose is 4 tablets daily: 2 in the morning, 1 at midday, and 1 in the evening.

CAMPRAL should be taken with meals to improve tolerability. Treatment is usually continued for at least one year, as studies have shown better long-term outcomes with extended use.



 Contraindications and Precautions

Do not take CAMPRAL if you:

- Are allergic to acamprosate or any of the tablet’s excipients
- Are pregnant or breastfeeding
- Suffer from severe kidney or liver disease

Caution is advised for patients with moderate renal impairment. CAMPRAL is not recommended for children or the elderly, and should be initiated under medical supervision.

Patients should not consume alcohol during treatment, as doing so reduces the effectiveness of the medication and may contribute to treatment failure.



 Side Effects

Common side effects include:

- Diarrhea
- Stomach discomfort
- Nausea and vomiting
- Rash or itchy skin
- Decreased libido or impotence

Uncommon side effects may include increased libido or allergic skin reactions. Serious allergic reactions such as anaphylaxis and angioedema are rare but require immediate medical attention.

Patients are encouraged to report any unusual symptoms to their healthcare provider or national drug monitoring authority.
