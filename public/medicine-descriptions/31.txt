 DISPRIN DIRECT 300 MG ORODISPERSIBLE TABLETS – PRODUCT INFORMATION

 1. Product Description

DISPRIN DIRECT® 300 mg Orodispersible Tablets contain acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), a well-established analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic medication. Each orodispersible tablet provides 300 mg of active ingredient and dissolves directly on the tongue without the need for water, offering rapid convenience for users seeking fast symptom relief.

The tablet is white, circular, and lemon-flavored, with a distinctive sword motif on one side. It is suitable for oral use only and is available in vinyl-coated, heat-sealed aluminium foil packs containing 24 tablets per carton.

 2. Composition

- Active ingredient: Acetylsalicylic acid – 300 mg per tablet
- Excipients: Glycine, maize starch, microcrystalline cellulose, purified talc, saccharin, and lemon flavouring

 3. Therapeutic Indications

DISPRIN DIRECT is indicated for the relief of mild to moderate pain, including:

- Headache
- Toothache
- Neuralgia
- Lumbago
- Muscular aches and pains
- Fever reduction
- Inflammation-related symptoms such as back pain or rheumatic discomfort

Due to its antiplatelet properties, aspirin is also widely used in cardiovascular protection; however, DISPRIN DIRECT is specifically formulated for symptom relief rather than long-term prophylactic use.

 4. Dosage and Administration

 Adults and Children (16 years and older):

- Dose: 1 to 2 tablets every 4–6 hours, up to a maximum of 12 tablets in 24 hours
- Route: Place the tablet on the tongue and allow it to disperse before swallowing. No water is required.

 Children under 16:

- Not recommended due to the association of aspirin with Reye’s syndrome unless prescribed by a doctor where the benefit clearly outweighs the risk.

 Elderly:

- No dose adjustment is generally required; however, extra caution is advised due to a higher incidence of gastrointestinal and bleeding risks. The lowest effective dose should always be used.

 Hepatic or Renal Impairment:

- Consultation with a physician is advised before use, as both conditions may increase the risk of adverse effects.

 5. Contraindications

DISPRIN DIRECT should not be used in patients with:

- Known hypersensitivity to acetylsalicylic acid, other NSAIDs, or any excipients
- A history of NSAID-induced asthma, gastric ulcers, or gastrointestinal bleeding
- Bleeding disorders such as hemophilia
- Severe hepatic, renal, or heart failure
- Children under 16 years (unless specifically indicated)
- During the third trimester of pregnancy
- Breastfeeding individuals

 6. Warnings and Precautions

- Should only be used when necessary and for short-term relief of symptoms
- Avoid prolonged or unsupervised use, particularly in elderly patients
- Use with caution in patients with gastrointestinal disorders, such as ulcers, Crohn’s disease, or colitis
- Discontinue use immediately if GI bleeding or ulceration occurs
- May precipitate bronchospasm in asthmatic individuals
- Aspirin inhibits platelet aggregation, increasing the risk of bleeding—particularly when used alongside anticoagulants, SSRIs, or corticosteroids
- Avoid use prior to surgical procedures due to prolonged bleeding time
- Use cautiously in patients with hypertension, heart failure, or fluid retention
- Rare risk of serious dermatologic reactions such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome

 7. Interactions

DISPRIN DIRECT may interact with:

- Anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin): increased bleeding risk
- NSAIDs and corticosteroids: increased risk of gastrointestinal toxicity
- SSRIs: increased GI bleeding potential
- Methotrexate: reduced clearance and increased toxicity
- Ibuprofen: may interfere with aspirin’s antiplatelet action
- Diuretics and antihypertensives: reduced therapeutic effect
- Oral hypoglycemics: risk of enhanced hypoglycemia
- Valproate and lithium: potential for increased toxicity
- Uricosurics: antagonistic effect on urate elimination
- Alcohol: amplifies gastrointestinal risk

Patients on complex medication regimens should consult their doctor before taking DISPRIN DIRECT.

 8. Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

- Contraindicated in the third trimester due to fetal and maternal risks such as premature ductus arteriosus closure and delayed labor
- Should be avoided during the first and second trimesters unless clearly necessary
- Not recommended during breastfeeding, as aspirin is excreted in small amounts in breast milk and may pose a risk of Reye’s syndrome to infants

 9. Side Effects

Very Common to Rare adverse events include:

- Gastrointestinal: nausea, vomiting, heartburn, GI bleeding, ulcers, perforation
- Skin: rash, urticaria, angioedema, severe reactions such as toxic epidermal necrolysis
- Respiratory: asthma, bronchospasm, nasal congestion
- Hematologic: thrombocytopenia, aplastic anemia
- Neurologic: headache, vertigo, blurred vision
- Renal and Hepatic: impairment in long-term or high-dose use

Stop taking the medication and seek immediate medical advice if symptoms of serious allergic reactions or bleeding occur.

 10. Overdose

Overdose symptoms include:

- Tinnitus, dizziness, hyperventilation
- Metabolic acidosis, confusion, vomiting
- GI bleeding, dehydration, respiratory failure in severe cases

Management: Activated charcoal within 1 hour, urinary alkalinisation with sodium bicarbonate, IV fluids for correction of acidosis, and hemodialysis in life-threatening cases.
