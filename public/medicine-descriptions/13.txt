 GLUCOBAY 100 MG 90 TAB – PRODUCT INFORMATION

 General Description

GLUCOBAY® 100 mg is an oral antidiabetic medication used primarily in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus and in the prevention of diabetes onset in individuals diagnosed with impaired glucose tolerance. Each tablet contains 100 mg of acarbose, an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor. The product is manufactured and distributed under the Bayer Schering Pharma AG license by Bayer Türk Kimya Sanayi Ltd. Şti., based in Istanbul, Turkey.

This pharmaceutical product is formulated to delay the digestion of carbohydrates by inhibiting enzymes in the small intestine, resulting in a slower and reduced postprandial (after-meal) rise in blood glucose levels. This mechanism of action makes GLUCOBAY® an effective medication when used alongside dietary control and physical exercise.

 Composition

- Active ingredient: Acarbose 100 mg per tablet  
- Excipients: Microcrystalline cellulose, colloidal anhydrous silica, magnesium stearate, and corn starch

GLUCOBAY tablets are round, light yellowish-white in color, with "G 100" engraved on one side and the Bayer logo on the other.

 Indications

GLUCOBAY® is indicated for:
- Treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in conjunction with dietary measures
- Management of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), also referred to as prediabetes
- Postprandial hyperglycemia control

This medication helps prevent the development of full-blown diabetes by addressing elevated blood sugar levels after meals.

 Dosage and Administration

GLUCOBAY® is administered orally. The recommended starting dosage is:
- 50 mg three times a day, or
- 100 mg divided as half a tablet three times daily

Depending on the patient's tolerance and blood glucose response, the dosage may be gradually increased to:
- 100 mg three times a day

Tablets should be taken with the first bites of a meal or immediately before eating, either by swallowing with a little liquid or by chewing.

In patients with impaired glucose tolerance, a typical dose is 100 mg three times daily, starting with 50 mg once daily and increasing over a three-month period.

 Contraindications

Do not use GLUCOBAY® if:
- You have known hypersensitivity to acarbose or other components
- You suffer from chronic intestinal disorders that affect digestion or absorption
- You have liver cirrhosis
- You have intestinal conditions that could be aggravated by gas formation (e.g., bowel obstruction or large hernias)
- You have severe renal impairment

 Precautions

- Liver function tests should be monitored every three months during the first year of treatment due to the potential for asymptomatic elevation of liver enzymes.
- Not recommended for individuals under 18 years of age.
- Use during pregnancy or lactation is not advised due to limited data on safety.
