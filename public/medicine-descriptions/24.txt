 MUCOLATOR PLUS 600 MG POWDER 30 SACHETS – PRODUCT INFORMATION

 1. Product Overview

MUCOLATOR PLUS® 600 mg Powder for Oral Solution in Sachets is a mucolytic medication used to treat respiratory disorders associated with thick, excessive mucus and to prevent liver damage caused by acetaminophen (paracetamol) overdose. Each sachet contains 600 mg of acetylcysteine, which acts by breaking down the mucus structure, facilitating its expulsion from the respiratory tract.

The product is presented as a light yellow powder in individual sachets, which should be dissolved in water before oral intake. It is available in packages containing 10 or 30 sachets.

 2. Composition

  - Chronic bronchitis

 6. Contraindications

MUCOLATOR PLUS should not be used in patients with:

- Active peptic ulcers or a history of gastrointestinal bleeding
- Esophageal varices
- Severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C)

 7. Warnings and Precautions

- Increased bronchial secretions may occur after use. Patients with compromised cough reflex or airway clearance must be monitored.
- Rare but severe skin reactions (e.g., Stevens-Johnson syndrome or Lyell’s syndrome) have been reported. Discontinue use if rashes or mucosal lesions develop.
- Use with caution in patients with liver cirrhosis or renal impairment, as acetylcysteine elimination may be reduced.
- Contains aspartame (source of phenylalanine); unsuitable for patients with phenylketonuria.
- Sorbitol content makes it unsuitable for those with hereditary fructose intolerance.

 8. Drug Interactions

Avoid concurrent use with:

- Cough suppressants (antitussives): Risk of mucus accumulation due to reduced cough reflex
- Antibiotics: Interaction risk with beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, macrolides, and tetracyclines. Space doses at least 2 hours apart
- Nitroglycerin: Enhanced vasodilatory and antiplatelet effects
- Carbamazepine: Potential to lower serum levels and increase seizure risk
- Activated charcoal: Reduces acetylcysteine absorption if administered together

Patients should inform their healthcare provider of all medications being taken, including herbal and over-the-counter products.

 9. Pregnancy and Lactation

 Pregnancy:
- Category B. Animal studies did not reveal direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy or fetal development. However, use in human pregnancy requires careful risk/benefit evaluation.

 Breastfeeding:
- It is not known whether acetylcysteine passes into breast milk. Use only if clearly needed and the benefit outweighs the potential risk to the infant.

 10. Side Effects

Reported adverse effects include:

 Common (≥1/100 to <1/10):
- Gastrointestinal: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea
- Headache, fever
- Skin reactions: Rash, hives, itching

 Uncommon to Rare:
- Bronchospasm, especially in asthma patients
- Hypotension, tachycardia
- Stomatitis, heartburn
- Anaphylactic reactions (rare)

In very rare cases, bleeding tendencies have been associated with acetylcysteine due to reduced platelet aggregation.

 11. Overdose

No life-threatening toxicity has been reported with acetylcysteine in oral forms, even at high doses.

 Symptoms:
- Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea
- Excessive secretion risk in infants

 Treatment:
- Symptomatic and supportive care is usually sufficient
