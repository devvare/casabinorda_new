 ZOVIRAX 5% W/W CREAM – PRODUCT INFORMATION

 General Description

ZOVIRAX® 5% w/w cream is a topical antiviral formulation designed for the treatment of cold sores caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV). Its active ingredient, aciclovir, targets the virus during its active replication phase, helping to reduce the duration and severity of cold sore outbreaks. This cream is intended for external use only and should be applied at the earliest signs of a cold sore, such as tingling, itching, or redness.

ZOVIRAX is a smooth, white to off-white cream available in 2g tubes. It is available both over the counter and through pharmaceutical distribution channels. The product is often obtained through licensed wholesale suppliers and may be involved in import and export activities within the EU and globally, depending on regional demand and authorization status.
