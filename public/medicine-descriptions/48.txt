 HUMIRA (adalimumab) 40 MG/0.4 ML – 2 SOLUTIONS FOR INJECTION IN PRE-FILLED SYRINGES – PRODUCT INFORMATION

 1. Product Description

HUMIRA® 40 mg/0.4 mL is a prescription-only biological medicine containing adalimumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody that targets tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), a pro-inflammatory cytokine. By binding TNF-α, HUMIRA prevents its interaction with cell surface receptors, thus reducing inflammation and controlling disease progression in various autoimmune and chronic inflammatory conditions.

Each pre-filled syringe contains 40 mg of adalimumab in 0.4 mL solution. The syringe is for subcutaneous use only, and the medicine is provided in a sterile, preservative-free solution. It is typically used in adults and children over 2 years old for multiple chronic conditions.

HUMIRA is made available through authorized pharmaceutical supply chains and wholesale distributors. In certain healthcare systems, the product is listed for regulated import or export to ensure access in global treatment protocols.
