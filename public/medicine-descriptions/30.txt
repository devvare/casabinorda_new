 CORASPIN 300 MG – PRODUCT INFORMATION

 1. Product Description

CORASPIN® 300 mg enteric-coated tablets contain 300 mg of acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), a widely used drug with antiplatelet, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic effects. Each tablet is coated to ensure that the active substance is released in the intestines, not in the stomach, thereby reducing the risk of gastric irritation and ulcers during long-term use.

CORASPIN is used primarily for cardiovascular protection in patients at risk of thromboembolic disorders. It is produced in a pharmaceutical formulation specifically designed for safe chronic use. Tablets are packaged in blisters of 30 white, enteric-coated tablets, intended for oral administration.

 2. Therapeutic Indications

CORASPIN 300 mg is used to prevent thromboembolic complications in various cardiovascular conditions. Indications include:

- Unstable angina pectoris as part of standard therapy
- Acute myocardial infarction (heart attack)
- Secondary prevention of reinfarction
- Prevention of vascular occlusion and thrombosis following cardiovascular surgery such as PTCA or CABG
- Prevention of transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) and ischemic stroke in high-risk patients

Its action is achieved by irreversible inhibition of platelet aggregation via cyclooxygenase enzyme (COX-1) suppression, effectively reducing thrombus formation.

 3. Dosage and Administration

 General Adult Dosage:
- 75–300 mg once daily, based on clinical need and physician recommendation

Take tablets 30 minutes before meals, swallowed whole with water. Do not chew, crush, or break the tablets to maintain the enteric coating integrity.

 Pediatric Use:
- Not recommended for individuals under 18 years due to the risk of Reye’s syndrome in viral infections

 Elderly:
- No specific adjustment needed, but greater monitoring is advised due to increased bleeding risk

 Renal or Hepatic Impairment:
- Contraindicated in patients with severe renal or hepatic failure

 4. Contraindications

Do not use CORASPIN 300 mg if:

- You are allergic to aspirin, other salicylates, or any tablet excipients
- You have a history of NSAID-induced asthma, urticaria, or allergic reactions
- You are experiencing active peptic ulcer or gastrointestinal bleeding
- You have a bleeding disorder (e.g., hemophilia)
- You suffer from severe heart failure, liver disease, or renal impairment
- You are concurrently using high-dose methotrexate (≥15 mg/week)
- You are in the last trimester of pregnancy

 5. Warnings and Precautions

- CORASPIN may cause gastric bleeding, especially with long-term use
- Caution in patients with peptic ulcers, kidney disease, or coagulation disorders
- Aspirin may prolong bleeding time; report use before any surgical procedure
- May precipitate asthma attacks in susceptible individuals
- May reduce uric acid excretion, potentially triggering gout
- Should be avoided in children and adolescents with viral infections due to the risk of Reye’s syndrome

Patients with G6PD deficiency may be at risk of hemolysis or hemolytic anemia following aspirin use, especially at high doses or during infections.

 6. Use in Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

 Pregnancy:
- Contraindicated in the third trimester due to risks of fetal cardiovascular complications, delayed labor, and maternal bleeding
- Use in the first two trimesters only if absolutely necessary and under medical supervision

 Breastfeeding:
- Aspirin passes in small amounts into breast milk. While occasional use may be acceptable, high or chronic dosing requires stopping breastfeeding.

Women of childbearing age should be advised to use appropriate contraceptive methods if aspirin is used long-term.

 7. Drug Interactions

CORASPIN 300 mg interacts with multiple drugs:

 Enhanced Effects and Risks:
- Anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin), antiplatelets, SSRIs – increased bleeding risk
- Methotrexate – increased toxicity
- NSAIDs, corticosteroids – enhanced gastrointestinal side effects
- Valproic acid – increased serum levels
- Sulfonylureas, insulin – increased hypoglycemia risk

 Decreased Effects:
- Diuretics, ACE inhibitors – reduced efficacy due to impaired renal perfusion
- Uricosuric agents (e.g., probenecid) – decreased effectiveness
- Metamizole, ibuprofen – may inhibit aspirin's cardioprotective effects

Combining aspirin with alcohol further increases the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding and should be avoided.

 8. Adverse Effects

 Common:
- Gastrointestinal discomfort: nausea, vomiting, heartburn
- Abdominal pain, dyspepsia
- Occult blood loss (microhemorrhages)

 Uncommon:
- Gastrointestinal ulcer or bleeding
- Melena (black stools), hematemesis
- Rash, urticaria, skin irritation

 Rare:
- Cerebral hemorrhage, especially in hypertensive or anticoagulated patients
- Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis, angioedema)
- Hemolytic anemia in patients with G6PD deficiency
- Asthma exacerbation, nasal congestion
- Renal failure, hepatic enzyme elevations

 Very Rare:
- Hypoglycemia, particularly in diabetic patients
- Erythema multiforme
- Tinnitus, dizziness, confusion (typically in overdose)

Report all adverse reactions via national pharmacovigilance systems to ensure continued safety evaluation.

 9. Overdose

 Symptoms:
- Tinnitus, hyperventilation, vomiting, confusion
- Metabolic acidosis, dehydration
- Hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia
- Gastrointestinal bleeding, respiratory failure, coma

 Management:
- Immediate medical attention is essential
- Supportive care: gastric lavage, activated charcoal, fluid/electrolyte management
- Severe cases may require hemodialysis

 10. Storage and Handling

- Store below 25°C in a dry environment
